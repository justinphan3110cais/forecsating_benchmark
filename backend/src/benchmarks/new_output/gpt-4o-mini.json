Conversely, the transaction has garnered support from various government officials, policy experts, and business analysts, who argue that it will help revitalize U.S. Steel and the country's declining steel industry and counter that Japan is a major economic partner and investor.\n\n> On March 14, 2024, the Biden Administration announced its opposition to the planned acquisition, echoing a statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to block the deal \"instantaneously\" if elected president in the upcoming 2024 presidential elections. The deal is undergoing an antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice, and a possible investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is different from most other approaches in that it can be untargeted as opposed to involving the targeting of specific pathogens.\n\nAs additional context, the following is a relevant description about mNGS [by](https://asm.org/Articles/2019/November/Metagenomic-Next-Generation-Sequencing-How-Does-It) the American Society for Microbiology:\n> Metagenomic NGS (mNGS) is simply running all nucleic acids in a sample, which may contain mixed populations of microorganisms, and assigning these to their reference genomes to understand which microbes are present and in what proportions. The ability to sequence and identify nucleic acids from multiple different taxa for metagenomic analysis makes this a powerful new platform that can simultaneously identify genetic material from entirely different kingdoms of organisms.\n\nThe purpose of this question is to understand whether untargeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing will be utilized on a large scale in the US for pathogen identification.",

It is a once-daily injected drug based on the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), whose biology has turned out to be a goldmine for the medical management of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide, which was developed by Novo Nordisk, causes about\u00a0[7%](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61375-1)\u00a0[loss](https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2011.158)\u00a0of body weight in people with obesity when paired with diet and exercise advice.\n\nBy tweaking the design of GLP-1-based drugs,\u00a0[Novo Nordisk discovered](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b00726)\u00a0another drug that had a much longer half-life in the blood and a substantially larger impact on body weight: semaglutide.

It's marketed under the brand name Wegovy in the US, and Ozempic or Rybelsus in other markets.\n\nGiven the checkered history of weight loss drugs, it's reasonable to be cautious about their safety. Semaglutide and related drugs often cause unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, and headache, but these are typically mild and transient if the dose is started low and escalated slowly.\u00a0[Few people](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183)\u00a0discontinue semaglutide due to side effects.\n\nSome studies have suggested that this class of drugs may increase the risk of\u00a0[thyroid](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2009-1272)\u00a0and\u00a0[pancreatic](https://doi.org/10.2337/db11-1109)\u00a0cancer in lab rodents. Yet\u00a0[randomized controlled trials](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-019-02055-z)\u00a0including 64,000 people with type 2 diabetes have not observed an increased risk of cancer, overall or at any specific site in humans. These trials are limited in duration and don't yet have enough people to reliably identify modest increases in the risk of low-frequency outcomes like thyroid and pancreatic cancer. Observational\u00a0[monitoring data](https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.645563)\u00a0are mixed but have not provided a clear signal of increased risk.\n\nImportantly, trials suggest that semaglutide\u00a0[reduces major](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1901118)\u00a0[cardiovascular events](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141)\u00a0by about one quarter, similar to cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. Furthermore, across seven trials in people with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide and related drugs reduce the overall risk of dying\u00a0[by 12%](https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-8587(19)30249-9).

    "question": "Will Nebraska legally allocate its electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis in the 2024 presidential election?",
    "background_text": "In US presidential elections, Nebraska is unusual in that it does not automatically award all of its Electoral College votes to the state-wide winner. Instead, it awards two of its five electoral votes to the state-wide winner, and one vote to the winner of each of its three Congressional districts. Nebraska has used this method [since 1992.](https://www.270towin.com/content/split-electoral-votes-maine-and-nebraska/) The only other state that currently allocates its electoral votes in this manner is Maine.\n\nWhile two of [Nebraska's Congressional districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska%27s_congressional_districts?useskin=vector) are strongly Republican, its [2nd district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska%27s_2nd_congressional_district?useskin=vector), concentrated around Omaha and its suburbs, is highly competitive, and [in 2023](https://www.cookpolitical.com/cook-pvi/2023-partisan-voting-index/118-district-map-and-list) had a [Cook Partisan Voting Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index?useskin=vector) of EVEN. In the [2022 midterms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Nebraska?useskin=vector), Republican Don Bacon won the district by less than three points. \n\nIn the [2016 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election?useskin=vector#Results_by_state), Donald Trump won NE-02 by 2.24 points; but in [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election?useskin=vector#Results_by_state), the district flipped, and Joe Biden won by 6.5 points.\n\nIn certain scenarios, Nebraska's 2nd district could play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\n\n For example, if incumbent president Joe Biden were to retain the three Rust Belt battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, but lose the three Sun Belt battleground states of Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia, and the rest of the electoral map were to remain unchanged from 2020, without Nebraska's 2nd district, Biden would have 269 electoral votes, one shy of the 270 needed to win an Electoral College majority. Winning NE-02 again would secure victory in this scenario; but failing to win it would result in a [contingent election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election?useskin=vector)\n\nAs of April 2024, there are [efforts underway](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/07/trump-nebraska-electoral-college/73229967007/) to have Nebraska revert to winner-take-all electoral vote allocation. Former president and Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump has called on the state to revert to WTA allocation, and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen has [urged the state legislature](https://twitter.com/TeamPillen/status/1777882507544793455) to pass a bill to that effect in an as-yet uncalled special legislative session: \n\n>I am steadfast in my commitment to get winner-take-all over the finish line, thereby honoring our constitutional founding, unifying our state and ending the three-decades-old mistake of allocating Nebraska's electoral votes differently than all but one other state.\n\n>Although it is now clear that WTA cannot pass during the regular legislative session, I look forward to partnering with legislative leaders to moving it forward in a special session, when there is sufficient support in the Legislature to pass it.\n\n>I will sign WTA into law the moment the Legislature gets it to my desk.",

This this is a sharp increase from the previous two-week period when it was 2.3%, though still a distant second to KP.3.1.1, a [descendant](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/3-things-to-know-about-xec-the-latest-covid-strain) of the FLiRT variants, which is at 57.2% according to the Nowcast (41.2% as of the latest weighted estimate). Results from [one recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618773v1) \"suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of this question, CDC estimates variant proportions using two-week periods, using two different calculations: weighted estimates and Nowcast estimates. According [to CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions):\r\n\r\n>Weighted estimates (provided for all two-week periods except the most recent two, two-week periods) are variant proportions that are based on empirical (observed) genomic sequencing data. These estimates are not available for the most recent two-week periods because of the time it takes to generate the sequencing data, including sample collection, specimen treatment, shipping, analysis, and upload into public databases.\r\n\r\n>Lineages with weighted estimates less than 1% of all circulating variants are combined with their parent lineage. When the weighted estimate of a lineage crosses the 1% threshold and has substitutions in the spike protein that could affect vaccine efficacy, transmission, or severity, it may be separated from its parent lineage and displayed on its own in the variant proportions data.\r\n\r\nIn contrast:\r\n\r\n>Nowcast estimates (provided for the most recent two two-week periods when the \"Nowcast on\" option is selected below) are model-based projections of variant proportions for the most recent two-week periods to enable timely public health action. CDC uses the Nowcast to forecast variant proportions before the weighted estimates are available for a given two-week period.\r\n\r\nDue to the greater reliability,  verifiability, and empirical basis of the Weighted estimate, this question resolves based on that figure.",

Thirty-five percent (35%) consider it unlikely that Biden\u2019s vice presidential choice will be president before his four-year term ends, but that includes only 14% who think it\u2019s Not At All Likely.\n\n>Even 49% of Democrats think it\u2019s likely Biden\u2019s vice president will become president in the next four years, although that compares to 73% of Republicans and 57% of voters not affiliated with either major party.",

Antimony, used in bullets, nuclear weapons production, and lead-acid batteries, is just one of many metals that China has a significant share of global production.\n\nThe announcement follows China's previous export controls [on graphite](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-use-graphite-export-restrictions-encourages-diversification) in 2023 and restrictions on germanium and gallium, two metals used in chipmaking, in response to U.S. efforts to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. These moves have led some industry experts to speculate that China may soon impose export controls on other critical metals, such as tungsten, which is nearly as hard as a diamond and used in weapons, semiconductors, and industrial cutting machines.\n\nChina's actions are seen by some as retaliatory measures against what it perceives as intrusions into its national interests. As a result, companies in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring alternatives to reduce their reliance on China for critical metals. However, it remains to be seen whether China will follow through with a blanket implementation of the latest export controls or announce restrictions on additional metals in the near future.",

To date, 27 Amendments have been approved, six have been disapproved and thousands have been discussed. \n\nArticle V of the Constitution prescribes how an amendment can become a part of the Constitution. While there are two ways, only one has ever been used. All 27 Amendments have been ratified after two-thirds of the House and Senate approve of the proposal and send it to the states for a vote. Then, three-fourths of the states must affirm the proposed Amendment.\n\nThe other method of passing an amendment requires a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States. That Convention can propose as many amendments as it deems necessary. Those amendments must be approved by three-fourths of the states.\n\nThe actual wording of Article V is: \u201cThe Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\u201d \n\nFollowing a number of firearm-related tragedies in recent times, and with significant debate regarding the role of government in society and the prudence of maintaining this individual right to own firearms, numerous individuals and groups have floated the possibility of amending or repealing the Second Amendment.",

    "background_text": "According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON546):\n\n> Between 24 October and 5 December 2024, Panzi health zone in Kwango Province of Democratic Republic of the Congo recorded 406 cases of an undiagnosed disease with symptoms of fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body ache. All severe cases were reported to be severely malnourished. Among the cases, 31 deaths have been registered. The majority of cases reported are among children, particularly those under five years of age. The area is rural and remote, with access further hindered by the ongoing rainy season. Reaching it from Kinshasa by road takes an estimated 48 hours. These challenges, coupled with limited diagnostics in the region, have delayed the identification of the underlying cause. Rapid response teams have been deployed to identify the cause of the outbreak and strengthen the response. The teams are collecting samples for laboratory testing, providing a more detailed clinical characterization of the detected cases, investigating the transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level. The teams are also aiding with the treatment of patients, risk communication and community engagement. Given the clinical presentation and symptoms reported, and a number of associated deaths, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as potential causal factors with malnutrition as a contributing factor. Malaria is a common disease in this area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases. Laboratory tests are underway to determine the exact cause. At this stage, it is also possible that more than one disease is contributing to the cases and deaths.",

The decision was made a day after the announcement of the Russian annexation of the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.\n> The announcement of mobilization was seen as a significant escalation of Russia's military efforts in the war with Ukraine. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia had a \"huge mobilization reserve\" and planned to mobilize 300,000 recruits. The precise details of the mobilization plans are currently unclear, however, as the exact number of people to be mobilized is classified.\n> On 28 October, Shoigu told Russian president Vladimir Putin that mobilization had been completed, which was followed an announcement by Putin of its completion.\n\nAs of this question's writing, there is a lot of uncertainty about second wave of mobilization. On one hand, [Russia suffered staggering losses](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11243/russian-military-deaths-by-2024/), and Ukraine plans to [mobilize 500'000 more troops](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-military-asks-additional-450000-500000-people-be-mobilised-zelenskiy-2023-12-19/) this year.

The individual had been infected after exposure to dairy cattle that were presumed to be infected. The infection marks the first reported case in humans the United States since an infection in Colorado in 2022.\n\n[CDC describes](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/reported-human-infections.htm) H5N1 infections in humans as follows:\n\n>HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 890 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 870  cases reported in 22 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. One case of asymptomatic infection was reported in Vietnam in 2011, and another asymptomatic case was reported in the United Kingdom that occurred in late 2021. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death.

    "background_text": "As Moscow has cracked down on independent Russian-language media since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube has remained a key platform for opposition figures and dissenting voices. However, recent reports of mass outages and slowdowns of the video-sharing platform in Russia have raised concerns about its future in the country.\n\nRussian lawmakers have [blamed Google](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/youtube-slowdown-russia-darkens-freedom-speech-outlook-2024-08-08/), which owns YouTube, for failing to upgrade its equipment in Russia since the invasion, leading to the slowdown that started in mid-July 2024. They claim that the degradation of service is a necessary step to persuade YouTube to reinstate blocked Russian channels. However, Google and technology experts dispute this explanation.\n\nA recent [Russian-language article](https://news.ru/russia/kogda-youtube-zarabotaet-normalno-v-rossii-chto-dlya-etogo-nuzhno/) discussed how this ban could still be in the works (translated by Google Translate):\n\n>According to the chairman of the Digital Economy Development Fund, German Klimenko, YouTube will be blocked in Russia in three to five months.\n\n>\"I think that testing is underway. YouTube's fate is probably predetermined, and it is similar to Instagram's fate (operations are prohibited in the Russian Federation). I would assume that YouTube will hang around for three to five months, and then be blocked,\" he said in a conversation with [aif.ru](https://aif.ru/society/web/-sudba-youtube-reshena-german-klimenko-o-durove-youtube-i-ii-v-seti).\n\nAdditionally:\n\n>Deputy Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Boris Chernyshov told NEWS.ru that large-scale work is currently underway to increase the capacity of Russian video hosting sites: Rutube, VK video and others, which should replace the American video hosting.\n\n>\"This can be seen from the strong advertising campaign of domestic services. And due to the decline in the quality of the YouTube service, which is currently working intermittently, many bloggers, presenters, and authors have begun to transfer their content to Russian platforms and duplicate all new releases there by default,\" Chernyshov said.\n\nHowever, Chernyshov subsequently [said](https://lenta.ru/news/2024/09/21/deputat-ob-yasnil-zayavlenie-o-polnoy-blokirovke-youtube-v-rossii/) he was misquoted.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and YouTube continue to escalate, this question aims to assess whether the Russian government will take the drastic step of officially banning the platform before January 1, 2025.",

    "background_text": "Proposition 33 ([Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_33,_Prohibit_State_Limitations_on_Local_Rent_Control_Initiative_(2024))) will appear on the state-wide ballot in California for the US General Election on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. It will pass if a simple majority who vote on the measure approve it. Since this question will be decided by popular vote, this question essentially asks whether sentiment in California had shifted since the post-Covid housing crisis on whether voters would be inclined to favor rent control. This might be a bellwether on popular attitudes on the housing crisis and progressive sentiment in the United States where people demand the government to take proactive measures to address certain social problems. \r\n\r\nProposition 33 would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which prevents local governments from enacting rent control on homes built after 1995 or if the tenants move out. Essentially, Proposition 33 will empower local governments to have more available courses of action to reduce rents. Governor Gavin Newsom passed a law in 2019 that capped rent increase in California to 5 percent plus the rate of inflation or a maximum of 10 percent. However, proponents of Proposition 33 argue that this is insufficient.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, tenant advocates support Proposition 33, while landlord interest groups are bankrolling the campaign against it. \r\n\r\nThe conventional wisdom among economists is that rent control will lower the supply of housing since it reduces the profit incentive for developers to produce more housing.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Proposition 21 was on the ballot, which would authorize cities to enact rent control ordinances. The Proposition only received 40.1 percent approval out of the votes of voted on the proposition. \r\n\r\nSources:\r\nhttps://calmatters.org/housing/2024/10/prop-33-2024-fact-check/\r\nhttps://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/proposition-21-rent-control/",

He went on to found Telegram messaging app which faced similar issues, and was blocked in Russia after refusal to provide encryption keys to FSB, which led to several years of whack-a-mole game between Roskomnadzor and Telegram, former trying to prevent access to latter, and Telegram [winning this game in 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_Telegram_in_Russia), when Roskomnadzor officially gave up.\n\nReportedly, neither Russian nor Western intelligence agencies currently have access to Telegram encryption keys and *encrypted* user messages. Pavel Durov [was arrested in France on August 24](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-detained-france.html) during his private jet emergency refueling stop, on accounts of assisting terrorism and drug trafficking (and some others, totaling 20) by refusing to provide Telegram encryption keys to French state agencies.",

    "question": "Will the nominated Republican presidential candidate receive over 50% of the valid votes in Texas in 2024 United States presidential election?",
    "background_text": "Texas has gradually been trending less Republican in the last quarter of a century. George W. Bush received 60% of the valid votes in the state in [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas) and [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas), while in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas) and [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas) the equivalent number was close to 52% in both elections.\n\n[Linear trend](https://i.imgur.com/0OybLvV.png), taking into account all the presidential elections since 2000, suggests that the Republican candidate would be close to the 50% mark in 2024 elections.\n\nAdditional consideration is the strength of third party candidates this cycle. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [has polled](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/texas/) in mid to high single digits in Texas, potentially stripping the Republican candidate of a majority of votes in the state. Ross Perot managed the feat in both [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas) and [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas) elections, though his vote share especially in 1992 was markedly higher.\n\nReceiving under 50% of the vote in Texas \u2013 especially if it happens without a sizeable third party candidate \u2013 would mark another milestone in the journey of the Lone Star State towards being a battleground for future presidential cycles, even if the Republican candidate ends up winning the state in 2024, as is all but sure.",

The IDF [said](https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/al-aqsa-storm-militants-infiltrate-israel-after-gaza-rockets-10-07-intl-hnk/h_011c2f08e2646aa47a072dcd2d1caf33) approximately 2,200 rockets were launched in the initial barrages, making it the largest rocket attack against Israel since Hamas took control of Gaza in [2007](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freedomhouse.org/country/gaza-strip/freedom-world/2021&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1696706417450975&usg=AOvVaw1huk_OBuqJV0SQOIKAP6BQ). The number of rockets launched was an order of magnitude larger than the attacks at the beginning of the [2014](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/systemfiles/Rocket%20Warfare%20in%20Operation%20Protective%20Edge.pdf) and [2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/world/middleeast/jerusalem-protests-aqsa-palestinians.html) crises. Hamas also appears to have been quite innovative, [using paragliders](https://news.sky.com/video/israel-hamas-fighters-appear-to-paraglide-across-border-in-released-footage-12978986) among other means to enter Israel by surprise. The infiltration is particularly devastating for Israel due to the lives lost and the hostages taken.\n\n> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [declared](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/07/world/israel-gaza-attack), \u201cWe are at war,\u201d and launched [Operation Iron Swords](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-762075), conducting airstrikes in Gaza and calling up reservists.

The [Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/iran-israel-hamas-strike-planning-bbe07b25):\n\n>Iranian security officials helped plan Hamas\u2019s Saturday surprise attack on Israel and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut last Monday, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed militant group.\n>\n>Officers of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked with Hamas since August to devise the air, land and sea incursions\u2014the most significant breach of Israel\u2019s borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War\u2014those people said.\n\nHowever, Iran has [denied that it was involved](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-denies-it-had-role-in-hamas-attack-on-israel-claims-accusation-is-political/) and [US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has stated](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/08/politics/us-intelligence-iran-connection-israel-attack/index.html):\n\n>In this specific instance, we have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack. That\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at very carefully, and we\u2019ve got to see where the facts lead.\n\nWhile Israel [does not publicly confirm that it has nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option#Nuclear_ambiguity), based on US intelligence the [Federation of American Scientists estimates](https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/) that Israel has 90 nuclear warheads.",

    "question": "Will the certification of the 2024 US Presidential election be delayed until after January 6, 2025 for any reason?",
    "background_text": "This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy: Will the certification of the 2024 US Presidential election be halted for any reason?\n\nThe [2024 US Presidential election](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election,_2024) will be held on 5 November 2024 between Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican nominee former president Donald Trump. The election will be the 60th of its kind since 1788\u201389. \n\nInstead of a direct popular vote, US presidents are elected via [the Electoral College](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about#:~:text=The%20Electoral%20College%20consists%20of,of%20Representatives%20plus%20two%20Senators.), a system whereby the president is determined by the number of electors they win from each state plus Washington, DC. There are 538 electors in total, with the number attributed to each state determined by the size of its House of Representatives in addition to two Senators. When a presidential candidate wins a state, they usually take all its electoral votes, with the candidate who wins at least 270 winning the presidency.\n\nThe results in a presidential election go through a process of [reporting, canvassing, and certifying](https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification) for them to be validated. On the state level, this begins with the publication of unofficial results after the polls close and until all the ballots are counted; the election is then \u201ccanvassed\u201d until all the election data is aggregated; finally, the results are \u201ccertified\u201d when election officials issue a written statement attesting that the election results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast. \n\n[Following this](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about), the newly formed Electoral College typically meets in their respective state capital between December 14 and 20 to cast their votes. These votes are then sent to Congress for final certification during a joint session the following year on January 6.\n\nIn the past, attempts have been made to delay certification on the state level. Although ultimately unsuccessful, [the 2020 fake electors](https://www.justsecurity.org/81939/timeline-false-electors/) plot shows this. \n\nBy contrast, only once in US history has certification by Congress been delayed. This occurred when [Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack) on January 6, 2021 in an attempt to prevent the joint session of Congress from counting the Electoral College and confirming Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 US Presidential election. The delay only lasted one day before the results were certified on January 7, 2021.\n\nThe efforts undertaken to overturn the 2020 election were unprecedented and remain a topic of significant controversy. Donald Trump, for example, has continued to claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d by the Democratic Party while the former president and many leading Republicans have also declined to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election, with some, such as Marco Rubio, outright refusing if they suspect \u201cfoul play\u201d.  Accordingly, the prospect is raised that the certification of the 2024 US presidential election may be delayed.",

The majority of the cases were epidemiologically linked to seafood, poultry and live wildlife market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) in Jianghan District of Hubei Province.
