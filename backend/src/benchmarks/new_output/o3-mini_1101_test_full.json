      "<facts>\n\u2022 Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is SWAPO\u2019s presidential candidate in the November 2024 Namibian general election.  \n\u2022 SWAPO has a long history of electoral success, though recent elections have shown some decline in support (e.g., 56.3% in 2019, compared to higher past figures).  \n\u2022 The 2019 election yielded 56.3% of the vote, which is above the 55% threshold in question.  \n\u2022 Recent news items indicate internal party tensions, controversies among high-profile SWAPO figures, and challenges (e.g., accusations of \u201cde-campaigning\u201d and internal victimization claims) that could affect voter sentiment.  \n\u2022 Endorsements, including from the Africa Women Conference, highlight the candidate\u2019s strengths and the symbolism of her candidacy for gender equality and empowerment.\n\u2022 Opposition forces (e.g., Popular Democratic Movement, Landless People\u2019s Movement) are noted as emergent challenges to SWAPO\u2019s dominance.\n</facts>\n\n<no>\n\u2022 Declining overall support for SWAPO compared to previous years may lower her vote share \u2013 Strength: 8/10  \n\u2022 Current internal disputes and controversies might weaken party unity and voter confidence \u2013 Strength: 7/10  \n\u2022 The potential influence of emerging opposition and fragmentation in the electorate could reduce the margin needed for 55% \u2013 Strength: 7/10\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n\u2022 Historical performance of SWAPO (56.3% in 2019) suggests achieving 55% remains feasible \u2013 Strength: 8/10  \n\u2022 Endorsements and the symbolic value of her candidacy as a female leader could mobilize a loyal support base \u2013 Strength: 7/10  \n\u2022 Traditional SWAPO electoral dominance and a well-established political machinery may secure sufficient votes despite recent challenges \u2013 Strength: 8/10\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe forecast involves balancing SWAPO\u2019s historical dominance against recent signs of internal strife and opposition challenges. The fact that the previous election yielded just above the 55% threshold suggests that under relatively stable voter turnout conditions, a modest continuation of SWAPO\u2019s support could suffice. However, internal controversies and a potential decline in public trust could lower the margin. Adjusting for potential news bias (overemphasis on controversy) and recalling that voters are often inclined to maintain familiar choices in a politically dominant party, the factors lean approximately evenly on both sides. Overall, the historical benchmark plus structural party strength lean toward a slightly better than even chance for achieving at least 55%, though not by a large margin. Considering the trade-offs and uncertainties, a probability near 0.55 appears reasonable.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>\n0.55\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nIn reviewing the factors, the prior performance in 2019 (56.3%) offers a base rate that is only marginally above the targeted threshold. Given the internal challenges reported in recent news, some downward pressure is likely, but the established nature of SWAPO\u2019s support and strong endorsements for Nandi-Ndaitwah suggest that reaching the 55% mark is still plausible. I have taken care to ensure that probabilities near the margins (such as 55% versus 56%) are clearly differentiated from very small or extreme probabilities. Overall, my process factors in both quantitative historical data and qualitative reports, while adjusting for potential negativity bias present in the media coverage.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.55*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "Former president Hage Geingob\u2019s top politicians were among those who were de-campaigned at the Swapo parliament list election this past weekend. This includes prime minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila, finance minister Iipumbu Shiimi, mines minister Tom Alweendo, and justice minister Yvonne Dausab. The others are information minister Emma Theofelus, National Planning Commission director general Obeth Kandjoze and Otjozondjupa governor James Uerikua. Additionally, a 48-person list aimed at \u201cfooling\u201d young delegates into believing they stand a good chance of making it to the parliament was allegedly circulated at the venue. Central committee member John Elago yesterday confirmed the alleged victimisation. \u201cMembers who are being de-campaigned have faith in the delegates. The delegates would not be swayed by a list intended to buy votes,\u201d he said. The Swapo electoral college, known as the \u2018pot\u2019 was expected to produce the party\u2019s elected list of parliamentarians for next year\u2019s National Assembly. However, complaints were rife that a targeted campaign against Geingob\u2019s ministers existed. Geingob injected new politicians into the system with various technical capacities to improve government efficiency, but it appears his intentions could be thwarted. Kuugongelwa-Amadhila was allegedly victimised. She challenged the party leadership two years ago. The prime minister is now said to be targeted for, among others, her decision to prioritise rural areas in the government\u2019s drought-relief programme. Some party members have allegedly pushed for the distribution to be extended to urban areas, where Swapo is trying to appeal for votes in the upcoming elections. Kuugongelwa-Amadhila yesterday said the spirit of unity must prevail. \u201cWith a sober mind knowing we are representing the broad membership of Swapo to elect from among party members who are all loyal and vetted to be capable of doing the job of representing the party in a spirit of unity and comradeship,\u201d she told New Era yesterday. GEINGOB\u2019S TECHNOCRATS Posters were circulated on Whats\u00adApp over the weekend targeting Shiimi for blocking controversial transactions that cost tax-payers money. These transactions are related to SME Bank, the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia (Namcor), and the Meat Corporation of Namibia, which honked up N$700 million of taxpayers\u2019 money. Shiimi, who made it to the men\u2019s pot yesterday, did not respond to The Namibian\u2019s questions when approached. \u201cI am in a hurry,\u201d he said. Alweendo, WhatsApp posters show, was targeted by vice president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaiwah\u2019s faction for saying Namibians are not entitled to exploration licences. Alweendo also supported Namcor\u2019s board in cleaning up the corruption-tainted national oil company, which took part in oil transactions of over N$500 million linked to a military outfit called Enercon. The minister did not answer questions yesterday. Swapo\u2019s parliamentary lists are expected to be announced today. The voting process was delayed yesterday. By 17h30 it has still not started. Sources said the printing of ballot papers were not done. \u2018YOU ARE ALL MY FAVOURITES\u2019 During the official opening of the electoral college in Windhoek yesterday, Nandi-Ndaitwah called for unity. \u201cAs your leader, I have been and will continue to tell you that you are all my favourites. We must continue to have that and continue to work as a team,\u201d she said. Minister of sport, youth and national service Agnes Tjongarero, who has been publicly blasted by Nandi-Ndaitwah over the delay in renovating Independence Stadium, yesterday confirmed she will not be looking to return to the parliament. Tjongarero did not make it to the 2024 electoral college ballot. Dausab, who became a minister after being selected by Geingob, has once again been excluded from the parliamentary list. It means her only chance of going back to the parliament now depends on whether Nandi-Ndaitwah will include her in the list of 10 people she can add to the 2024 electoral college ballot. Dausab did not respond to questions yesterday. Those who were close to Geingob, such as Kunene regional governor Marius Sheya, Shiimi, deputy sport minister Emma Kantema-Gaomas, and minister of education, arts and culture Anna Ngipondoka, could be seen dancing together at the official opening. Others were deputy minister of gender equality, poverty eradication and social welfare Royal /Ui/o/oo and Dausab. PREACHING UNITY Speaking at the official opening yesterday, president Nangolo Mbumba urged delegates to vote peacefully without any pressure \u201cwhatsoever\u201d and in the spirit of comradeship to avoid unnecessary division within the party. \u201cI would also like to encourage delegates to vote in a manner that reflects the unity and diversity of our country. No one, and I say no one, must feel left out. \u201cSwapo is the people, and the people are Swapo, which means Swapo is the home of all the Namibian people who are its members, supporters and sympathisers,\u201d he said. He said democracy has winners and losers. \u201cSome will win and others will regrettably lose. However, the entire Swapo party will be the winner. Through this process we will be stronger and better prepared for total victory on 27 November,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter this contestation, we must not bear grudges. As president Hage Geingob used to say, play the ball and not the person.\u201d Mbumba said those who will be elected must work hard to achieve a people-centred development and ensure a closer move to victory during the second struggle for economic liberation of all Namibians. He said Namibians want successful, prosperous and happy lives. \u201cTherefore, they expect of you, as their elected leaders, to provide all these things,\u201d he said. Swapo secretary general Sophia Shaningwa said Nandi-Ndaitwah will launch the party\u2019s manifesto on 14 September. She said the manifesto has been cleared and approved by the party\u2019s central committee at a meeting on Saturday. \u201cWe shall therefore reference our renewed commitments and achievements as outlined in the manifesto to convince our people to continue trusting the Swapo party, through which their hopes and aspirations can be released. Only Swapo and no one else,\u201d Shaningwa said. She said there are no winners and losers in elections. \u201c\u2026 hence the party will always emerge victorious. We indeed have a lifetime commitment to our party and not to ourselves,\u201d she said.",

          "raw_content": "IMAGE: Namibia Fact Check The digital threats that have been seen around elections elsewhere are rearing up ahead of Namibia\u2019s November 2024 elections NOTE: This article has been edited to substitute \u201cdeepfakes\u201d for cheapfakes in the image, headline and other parts of the text. With a third of the world\u2019s countries having or having already had elections in 2024, artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfake generating technologies have risen as threats to political and electoral processes. Namibia will probably also see AI-generated deepfakes \u2013 whether video or audio \u2013 appear on the political landscape as the country moves closer to the elections. In fact, Namibian politics-related AI-generated fakes have already started circulating in Namibian social media spaces, and even though these early examples come across as rather crude, they point to what could be coming. The Donald Trump clip In mid-March 2024 a video clip of former US president Donald Trump talking about blowing up Namibian uranium started circulating in Namibian WhatsApp and other social media spaces. The clip, which appears to have primarily been shared in Namibian WhatsApp groups through March and April 2024, was created using a free online AI voice and video generator, Parrot AI, which allows the user to convert text to speech and to use an American celebrity voice to say what the user wants them to say. The audio-visual clip of the former US president was taken from a May 2017 interview conducted by Lester Holt of the US\u2019s NBC News network about the then US president\u2019s firing of the head of the country\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the election context, the Parrot AI voice generator of Donald Trump has been used to encourage Pakistani-Americans to support the former US president\u2019s campaign for a second term in the US presidency, which will also be decided by elections in November 2024. In this instance the clip was used to show Trump encouraging Americans of Pakistani origin to vote for him so that he could set jailed former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan free once elected. The clip had to be debunked because it went viral in Pakistani social media spaces in March, following elections in the country in February 2024 in which Imran Khan\u2019s party did very well, even though he was in jail. The Joe Biden clip In mid-April 2024, a similar video clip of current US president Joe Biden also started circulating in Namibian WhatsApp and other social media spaces. While it\u2019s unclear what the original source is of the Joe Biden audio-visual fake, the US president\u2019s voice is used in this instance to mention the oil discoveries off the Namibian coast over recent years and to express \u201cfull support\u201d for the ruling Swapo Party and its candidate for Namibia\u2019s presidency, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, in this year\u2019s elections. The Biden clip also appears to have been generated using the Parrot AI application, even though it does not have the Parrot AI watermark on it. An online image search reveals that the Biden voice generator has been extensively used recently to say a variety of things.

The election follows the 2019 general election, where the ruling SWAPO party, led by President Hage Geingob, won with 56.3% of the vote. Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the current Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, has been nominated as SWAPO's presidential candidate for the upcoming election. \n\nNandi-Ndaitwah has a long political career, having served in various capacities since Namibia's independence in 1990. Her candidacy marks a significant moment as she is the first woman to lead SWAPO in a presidential election. The political landscape in Namibia has been characterized by SWAPO's dominance, but there are emerging challenges from opposition parties, including the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) and the Landless People's Movement (LPM), which may impact voter sentiment.\n\nVoter turnout and public opinion will be crucial in determining whether Nandi-Ndaitwah can secure 55% or more of the vote in the first round. Factors such as economic conditions, public perception of SWAPO's governance, and the effectiveness of opposition campaigns will play a significant role in shaping the election outcome. As the election date approaches, the political dynamics will continue to evolve, influencing the potential for Nandi-Ndaitwah's success.",

The election follows the 2019 general election, where the ruling SWAPO party, led by President Hage Geingob, won with 56.3% of the vote. Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the current Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, has been nominated as SWAPO's presidential candidate for the upcoming election. \n\nNandi-Ndaitwah has a long political career, having served in various capacities since Namibia's independence in 1990. Her candidacy marks a significant moment as she is the first woman to lead SWAPO in a presidential election. The political landscape in Namibia has been characterized by SWAPO's dominance, but there are emerging challenges from opposition parties, including the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) and the Landless People's Movement (LPM), which may impact voter sentiment.\n\nVoter turnout and public opinion will be crucial in determining whether Nandi-Ndaitwah can secure 55% or more of the vote in the first round. Factors such as economic conditions, public perception of SWAPO's governance, and the effectiveness of opposition campaigns will play a significant role in shaping the election outcome. As the election date approaches, the political dynamics will continue to evolve, influencing the potential for Nandi-Ndaitwah's success.",

          "raw_content": "Namibian president Hage Geingob used his recent state visit to South Africa to also address a meeting of the national executive committee of the governing party, the African National Congress (ANC). This underscored the ANC\u2019s historic ties to Namibia\u2019s governing party, South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo). According to President Cyril Ramaphosa, who also heads the ANC, the party had a \u201cwonderful engagement\u201d with Geingob, who posted on Facebook: As former liberation movements, we learn from one another, a manifestation of the deep bonds of solidarity formed during our struggle against oppression. As political scientists and sociologists, we both followed individually and jointly the performance of the two organisations since the days of the liberation struggles. We have continuously analysed and commented on trends in their governance of the countries. In our view, the nostalgic reminiscences of the parties\u2019 days as liberation movements serve as a heroic patriotic history turned into a form of populism. Such romanticism uses the merits of the past to cover failures in the present. It also is a potential threat to the achievements of constitutionalism. Geingob\u2019s visit came at a time when both governments under the former liberation movements, Swapo and the ANC, face an erosion of their political legitimacy. With elections in 2024 in both countries, their challenges are similar. Both face tough choices about how best to handle the challenges when entering the election year. They have, since moving into office, disappointed expectations, not least in their failures to fight corruption. Voters in South Africa and Namibia will in 2024 pass their verdict at the ballot boxes. How they perform will shape the future of democracy in both countries. History with lasting bonds South African-Namibian relations have a special history. After the first world war, the Treaty of Versailles officially ended the war between Germany and the Allied powers. It turned the German colony South West Africa into a C-mandate of the new League of Nations. Its administration was delegated to South Africa. It effectively annexed the territory and entrenched apartheid. This led the national liberation movement Swapo to take up arms. Recognised by the UN General Assembly as the \u201csole and authentic representative of the Namibian people\u201d, Swapo and the ANC, which had likewise launched an armed struggle, became close allies. Both received wide international support. From liberation movements to governments Under UN supervised elections in November 1989, Swapo obtained an absolute majority (58%). Independence was proclaimed on 21 March 1990. The date was chosen by the elected Constituent Assembly in recognition of the Sharpeville massacre in 1961 \u2013 when apartheid police murdered 69 unarmed black people protesting against being forced to carry identity documents controlling their movement. Released only weeks earlier from prison, Nelson Mandela attended the ceremony as the celebrated guest of honour. Apartheid in South Africa came officially to an end through the result of the first democratic elections in 1994. Like Swapo, the ANC emerged as the majority party (62.7%). It indicated the success of the democratic settlements in both countries that Swapo and the ANC led processes leading to the drawing up of final constitutions. These embedded accepted democratic principles: free and regular elections, independent judiciaries, bills of fundamental human rights, and the separation of powers of the three branches of government. Since then, both countries have continued to rank among the top African democracies. Regular elections were largely free and fair. Judiciaries have remained independent and have served as a check on executive power. Both parties initially increased their majorities. Crucially, however, the parliaments dominated by Swapo and the ANC have failed to hold governments to account on major issues. Popularity in decline Support for the ANC peaked at nearly 70% in the third democratic election in 2009, but by the 5th election in 2019, it had fallen to 57.5%. Even this was regarded as a triumph, put down to the personal popularity of its latest leader, Cyril Ramaphosa. In the run-up to the elections in 2024, surveys predict the ANC will lose its absolute majority, and be forced to form a coalition to remain in power. It is also anticipated that it will lose its majority in several provinces. It may even lose Gauteng, the country\u2019s economic hub, and KwaZulu-Natal. It has long lost control of the Western Cape to the opposition Democratic Alliance. In Namibia, Swapo has fared comparatively better. By 2014, it had consolidated its political dominance into a whopping 80% of votes for the National Assembly, and 86% of votes for its directly elected presidential candidate Hage Geingob. But the National Assembly and presidential elections in 2019 marked a turning point. With 65.5% the party lost its two-third majority. For both, ANC and Swapo, the loss of control over the regional, provincial and local levels of government has turned politics into a matter of alliances, with shifting coalitions. Politics has become a negotiated commodity. Principles are regularly traded for power, eroding the trust which citizens place in politicians and democracy. For all that they continue to dominate central government. But, their dominance is being steadily eroded by their lacklustre performance in power and failures in delivery of basic services. State capture has become a form of governance. 2024 and the limits to liberation It is too early for any reliable predictions regarding the 2024 election results. While many assume that the ANC will lose its absolute majority, it has an uncanny ability to defy expectations. But even if it squeaks home, its credibility is likely to be further damaged. Unless he is shuffled aside by the ANC (a possibility whispered quietly in dark corners as the brightness of his image dims), Ramaphosa is likely to remain in office as South Africa\u2019s president. But he could be compelled to lead a coalition government. Swapo\u2019s electoral prospects seem less bleak, even though it is thought that the opposition will make gains. Geingob\u2019s two terms as state president ends. Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah Swapo\u2019s first female candidate, might become the head of state. But in both countries, those holding office will face an uphill battle. Numerous analyses have explored how former liberation movements in southern Africa have failed the ideals of the liberation struggle when in power, even becoming undemocratic and increasingly corrupt. They have transited from dominance to decline. In many ways, this was to be expected. Few parties can retain power for decades without losing their popularity. Yet in southern Africa, liberation movements\u2019 loss of popularity is combined with accusations that they have betrayed the promises of freedom. They have displayed a democratic deficit. By dismissing accountability for the lack of delivery they have squandered their trust and support.",

      "<facts>\n\u2022 As of early January 2025, Southern California is experiencing several significant wildfires, including a fire that has burned over 25,000 acres near Los Angeles with reported fatalities.  \n\u2022 Powerful Santa Ana winds with gusts reaching up to 100 mph are exacerbating the fire spread and complicating containment efforts.  \n\u2022 Extremely dry conditions and a prolonged drought are present, severely increasing vegetation flammability.  \n\u2022 A \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d fire risk has been declared for much of the area, with warnings in effect.  \n\u2022 Recent news reports (Jan 8\u201316, 2025) emphasize ongoing wildfire activity and challenges in containment, with some fires only partially contained (e.g., 11\u201315% containment reported).  \n\u2022 The traditional wildfire season in California spans from late summer through early winter; although January is early, the abnormal fire weather suggests conditions are extreme.\n</facts>\n\n<no>\n\u2022 Improved firefighting efforts and strategic containment might eventually bring at least some large fires under control by mid-February. (Strength: 5)  \n\u2022 A potential change in weather \u2013 for instance, a slight chance of rain noted in January \u2013 could alter conditions enough to help suppress the fires before February 15. (Strength: 4)\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n\u2022 The ongoing intensity and scale of the wildfires in early January, combined with exceptionally dry, drought-stricken conditions and sustained high winds, suggest that some large, non-contained fires could persist. (Strength: 8)  \n\u2022 Historical patterns indicate that when wildfires reach such destructive proportions and occur under extreme environmental stress, they often continue burning for weeks or even months before being fully contained. (Strength: 7)  \n\u2022 The critical fire weather warnings and persistent adverse environmental factors make it likely that severe fire conditions will extend into mid-February. (Strength: 8)\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe initial factors such as extreme wind and drought conditions, mass area burn, and the low percentage of containment for some of the fires indicate that even with ongoing firefighting efforts, the inherent environmental stress is likely to sustain at least one large, non-contained wildfire into mid-February. Although mitigation measures and slight weather improvements might help, these efforts may not be enough to overcome the scale of the fires given the extreme conditions. Adjusting for potential news bias that might amplify the severity, the baseline environmental risks and historical longevity of such fires suggest a robust probability that the situation will persist on February 15, 2025.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.75</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReviewing the conditions, the severe drought, and continuous extreme weather hazards in California, the likelihood of having at least one active, large, non-contained fire persisting on February 15 appears quite significant. The probability estimate considers both the possibility of effective fire containment and weather improvements (which could lower the risk) as well as the opposing forces of extreme environmental stress and the nature of large wildfires (which tend to endure). The final probability acknowledges a higher risk than a minor chance, yet recognizes the potential for some mitigation. This calibrated assessment aligns with historical trends of prolonged large fire events under similarly extreme conditions in California.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.75*</answer>"

You can also get a quick briefing of national, regional and local weather whenever you like with the FOX Weather Update podcast. New wildfire erupts in California as \u2018particularly dangerous\u2019 fire threat returns to region A new wildfire broke out in Ventura County late Monday night as thousands of firefighters in California continued their work to extinguish other deadly blazes that have scorched thousands of acres of land in the Los Angeles area since last week. The wildfire, which is called the Auto Fire, ignited in Ventura and was about 56 acres with 0% containment. This new fire comes as forecasters issued a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation\" Fire Weather Warning in Southern California due to dry conditions, low relative humidity and the return of dangerous Santa Ana winds. Lake-Effect Snow Warnings issued as winter weather blasts Northeast communities Nearly 1 million people in portions of New York and Pennsylvania are under a Lake-Effect Snow Warning as more winter weather blasts the Northeast. According to the FOX Forecast center, Tuesday's lake-effect snow is expected to once again impact the southern shore of Lake Erie from Erie, Pennsylvania, to areas just south of Buffalo, as well as the eastern shore of Lake Ontario across the Tug Hill Plateau and Watertown, New York, area. This region has seen some of the most snow in the country so far this winter season. Watch: Harrowing video captures aerial Los Angeles firefighters' view above fiery abyss As firefighters battle the raging infernos in Southern California, harrowing video released by the Los Angeles Fire Department showed their helicopters plunging into the heart of the flames. The LAFD's Air Operations released the video Friday that showed helicopters flying above California's Santa Monica Mountains as the Palisades Fire rages below. The chilling footage offers a glimpse into the perilous conditions faced by aircrews, who are risking their lives to combat the blazes.

A\u200b major Santa Ana windstorm that has fanned destructive wildfires while also downing trees and knocking out power in Southern California continues Wednesday, but will ease some as we head into Thursday. (\u200bMORE: Latest On Palisades Fire And Others) \"Particularly Dangerous Situation\" red flag warnings have been issued. The National Weather Service (NWS) offices in Los Angeles and San Diego have issued their highest level of this warning type for at least part of this event. As we've already seen, this means the fire danger is extreme, fanning wildfires that have grown out of control quickly given the combination of high winds and tinder-dry conditions. The particularly dangerous situation red flag warnings include much of Los Angeles and eastern Ventura counties as well as inland Orange County, the Santa Ana mountains, the Inland Empire and the San Bernardino mountain foothills. T\u200bhe strongest winds are expected through mid-afternoon Wednesday. Winds will slacken on Thursday, but remain gusty in parts of Southern California. F\u200briday could bring another uptick in gusty Santa Ana winds, followed by a lull Saturday. Santa Ana winds will likely return again early next week. W\u200bind gusts around 100 mph had been clocked in a few spots Wednesday. That includes a gust to 98 mph to the west of the Palisades Fire and 100 mph gust north of La Canada Flintridge. The top gust so far is 103 mph at Marshall Peak in the mountains north of San Bernardino. Strong winds have been noted in lower elevations as well. The B\u200burbank airport reported a gust to 83 mph. D\u200bowned trees and power outages have been reported in areas near and north of Los Angeles. Here's the setup causing the extreme fire danger: Santa Ana winds are caused by strong high pressure over the Great Basin region of the West creating a pressure gradient that amps up winds through the mountains, foothills and sometimes valleys of Southern California. In this case, the winds are getting a major boost from a strong upper-level low pushing southward across the state. In addition, paltry rainfall so far this rainy season has placed Southern California in drought for the first time since February 2023. Rainfall in Los Angeles is just 4% of average since Oct. 1. T\u200bhe combination of those factors will continue to make for dangerous wildfire conditions Southern California until significant rainfall returns at some point in the future.",

          "raw_content": "Santa Ana gusts aren\u2019t going anywhere, as meteorologists expect north-to-northeast winds to pick up Saturday night and continue into Wednesday evening for Southern California\u2019s mountain and foothill communities. Periods of elevated critical fire weather are expected to peak Saturday night into Sunday and then again Monday night through Tuesday as winds could gust up to more than 75 mph for the eastern part of the mountain ranges in Los Angeles County. Weather forecasters say the turbulent conditions may help push the Eaton fire in the Altadena area farther south. Our concern is winds picking up tonight and then on Monday through Wednesday,\u201d said National Weather Service meteorlogist Rose Schoenfield. \u201cThe general duration of this is not looking good.\u201d A red flag warning issued for this evening starting at 6 p.m. has been extended to Wednesday night, as well as a fire watch warning. Although Santa Ana wind events will affect the mountain and foothill communities of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, they will likely have a stronger impact for the Santa Susana Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said his crews were gearing up for another dangerous increase in winds that will, no doubt, cause further challenges for ongoing firefights. As of Saturday, the Palisades fire was 11% contained and the Eaton fire, which devastated much of Altadena and is now burning mostly in the San Gabriel Mountains, was 15% contained. Marrone warned that more power shutoffs, initiated to limited potential fire starts from electrical equipment, will likely occur over the next few days. \u201cPlease understand the inevitable public safety power shutoffs that will be implemented prior to this life-threatening Santa Ana wind event are crucial to preventing new fire starts, and that they help save lives,\u201d he said. \u201cYes they are challenging to deal with, but it\u2019s certainly better than having another fire start.\u201d On Saturday, Southern California Edison reported that more than 300,000 customers across the region -- about 80,000 in L.A. County -- are under consideration for further power cuts \u201cdue to heightened wildfire risk.\u201d About 20,000 customers across L.A. County remain without power from the planned shutoffs.Don Fregulia, an operations section chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said crews responding to the Eaton fire are still dealing with hot spots and flare-ups, including near some neighborhoods. \u201cWe\u2019re using all the tools in our tool box to put this fire out,\u201d Fregulia said. But he admitted this is a long fight: \u201cIt\u2019s many days, many weeks of work.\u201d While the dry weather is expected to last through the middle of the week, Schoenfeld said Thursday could potentially bring a respite, offering a small chance of rain and improving humidities. \u201cIdeally it would be a rainstorm, but we\u2019ll take what we can get,\u201d Schoenfeld said.",

          "raw_content": "Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley lashed out at city leaders on Friday, Jan. 10, saying that budget cuts to her department hampered firefighters\u2019 ability to respond to the deadly wildfires that have ravaged Southern California. Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for an investigation into reports of the unavailability of water supply from the Santa Ynez Reservoir. Asked by a Fox 11 News reporter if the city \u201cfailed\u201d her and her department, Crowley first said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to stand up as a chief and exactly say, justifiably, what the fire department needs to operate to meet the demands of the community.\u201d She was asked twice more whether the city failed her. After the third time, she responded with one word: \u201cYes.\u201d In another interview, Crowley said a $17 million budget cut to her department has had a negative impact. \u201cLet me be clear. The $17 million budget cut and elimination of our civilian positions like our mechanics did and has and will continue to severely impact our ability to repair our apparatus,\u201d Crowley said on CNN, adding that more than 100 fire apparatuses are out of service. \u201cHaving these apparatus and the proper amount of mechanics would have helped,\u201d she said. Her remarks led to a late-afternoon closed-door meeting with Bass at City Hall. The two met at a time when they had been scheduled to be delivering a public update on the fight against the various fires burning in the area. As a result, only Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell spoke at that briefing. After the meeting ended, a representative for the mayor\u2019s office told reporters Crowley had not been fired or resigned, and she was still LAFD chief. Over the past few days, there have been questions and confusion about whether city officials cut the fire department\u2019s budget and what, if any, impacts the cuts may have had on firefighters\u2019 ability to respond to this week\u2019s windstorms. On Thursday, a spokesperson for L.A. City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who was budget chair last year, noted that the fire department\u2019s overall budget increased this fiscal year. But some news outlets and critics of L.A. Mayor Karen Bass suggested this week that there were cuts to areas of the fire department\u2019s budget. On Friday, Crowley told Fox 11 News that there were cuts to her department. \u201cYes, it was cut and it did impact our ability to provide service,\u201d she said. She also said the fire department was not made aware that the Santa Ynez water reservoir was empty. There had been reports earlier this week that there weren\u2019t enough water for firefighters to fight the fires. The mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Crowley\u2019s remarks. In a letter addressed to the heads of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and L.A. County Public Works, Newsom ordered officials to prepare a comprehensive review examining their preparation and response procedures to ensure available water supply for emergencies. He also demanded documents detailing any causes of the loss of water pressure and unavailability of water supplies. \u201cThe ongoing reports of the loss of water pressure to some local fire hydrants during the fires and the reported unavailability of water supplies from the Santa Ynez Reservoir are deeply troubling to me and to the community,\u201d Newsom wrote. \u201cWhile water supplies from local fire hydrants are not designed to extinguish wildfires over large areas, losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need answers to how that happened,\u201d Newsom wrote, \u201c\u2026 I am requesting you to fully and transparently share information and records for the state\u2019s after-incident review.\u201d On Friday, Newsom invited Trump \u2014 who blamed the initial lack of water on the governor\u2019s water policies \u2014 to visit California. \u201cThe hundreds of thousands of Americans \u2014 displaced from their homes and fearful for the future \u2014 deserve to see us all working together in their best interests, not politicizing a human tragedy and spreading disinformation from the sidelines,\u201d Newsom said. The Palisades Fire broke out Tuesday, and has grown to over 21,000 acres, leveling much of the Pacific Palisades. At least five people have died in the fire. Gus Corona, business manager for IBEW Local 18, the union representing DWP employees, supported Newsom\u2019s call for accountability. He encouraged city leaders to evaluate the work of the DWP\u2019s general manager and the entire water group leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that this reservoir was empty for almost a year for a minor repair,\u201d Corona said. \u201cThis work should have been done by DWP crews.\u201d On Wednesday, Bass said she was frustrated that the Los Angeles Fire Department had limited resources to combat the Palisades Fire. Bass, among other city officials, explained the dire situation firefighters were in with dangerous Santa Ana winds preventing air support and extreme demand on the water system. Bass said that fire hydrants were not constructed to deal with the massive devastation happening in the Palisades. \u201cThe No. 1 problem, especially on Wednesday, was the fact that we did not have air support because of the winds,\u201d Bass said. She noted that with winds subsiding, firefighters began water drops. \u201cAs winds change, our resources change, we redistribute and we move,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThat\u2019s the dynamic situation that we are in \u2014 even in day three.\u201d L.A. Department of Water and Power CEO Janisse Qui\u00f1ones previously said there were three water tanks available for firefighters in the Palisades Fire, but high demand drained resources. Firefighters also dealt with low water pressure at higher elevations \u2014 an issue Qui\u00f1ones said the department is working to solve. DWP officials cited old infrastructure and, again, extreme demand for water. Qui\u00f1ones noted that about 200 of the approximately 1,000 fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades were without water. The lack of water in some hydrants drew criticism in some political quarters, including from President-elect Donald Trump, who slammed Newsom for decisions on water diversion during Trump\u2019s first term. City News Service contributed to this report",

This led to a closed-door meeting with Mayor Karen Bass, who later expressed frustration over the limited resources available to combat the Palisades Fire, which has burned over 21,000 acres and resulted in at least five deaths. \n\nCrowley stated that the fire department was unaware of the Santa Ynez reservoir's emptiness, which affected firefighting efforts. Newsom ordered a review of water supply procedures, expressing concern over reports of low water pressure at fire hydrants during the crisis. He emphasized the need for accountability and transparency regarding the water supply issues. Meanwhile, Bass noted that high winds prevented air support for firefighters, complicating their efforts. The L.A. Department of Water and Power acknowledged that old infrastructure and high demand contributed to the water shortages, with many hydrants in the affected area lacking water. The situation has drawn criticism from various political figures, including President-elect Donald Trump, who blamed state water policies for the crisis.",

When asked if the city failed her, Crowley responded affirmatively, citing a $17 million budget cut that negatively impacted the department's operations and left over 100 fire apparatuses out of service. This led to a closed-door meeting with Mayor Karen Bass, who later expressed frustration over the limited resources available to combat the Palisades Fire, which has burned over 21,000 acres and resulted in at least five deaths. \n\nCrowley stated that the fire department was unaware of the Santa Ynez reservoir's emptiness, which affected firefighting efforts. Newsom ordered a review of water supply procedures, expressing concern over reports of low water pressure at fire hydrants during the crisis. He emphasized the need for accountability and transparency regarding the water supply issues. Meanwhile, Bass noted that high winds prevented air support for firefighters, complicating their efforts. The L.A. Department of Water and Power acknowledged that old infrastructure and high demand contributed to the water shortages, with many hydrants in the affected area lacking water. The situation has drawn criticism from various political figures, including President-elect Donald Trump, who blamed state water policies for the crisis.",

          "raw_content": "In light of the ongoing devastation wrought by the numerous wildfires plaguing Los Angeles County, California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency[1] and taken immediate action in an attempt to allow Angelenos to rebuild efficiently and effectively. One such action was the issuance of Executive Order (EO) N-4-25 on January 12th to temporarily suspend two time-intensive environmental laws.[2] In response, the City of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued her own executive order (Emergency Executive Order No. 1 [LA EEO1]) just one day later to \u201cclear the way for Los Angeles residents to rapidly rebuild the homes they lost.\u201d[3] EO N-4-25 will, in short, suspend the permitting and review requirements under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Coastal Act for victims of the recent fires in Los Angeles County in order to promote the restoration of homes and businesses. In addition to confirming the waiver of CEQA review, LA EEO1 waives local discretionary review processes. These fires, which \u2013 as of the date of publication \u2013 have resulted in the destruction of more than 12,000 structures, in the midst of an undeniable housing crisis in California. These executive orders are a step in the right direction to recoup the housing stock lost over the past two weeks. EO N-4-25 The executive order issued by Governor Newsom: Suspends CEQA review and Coastal Act permitting related to the reconstruction of properties substantially damaged or destroyed in the wildfires. The structures eligible for this suspension must be in the substantially same location and shall not exceed 110% of the footprint and height of properties and facilities that were legally established and existed immediately before the fires. This suspension means that applications to rebuild homes, businesses, and other structures will not have to comply with laws that are notorious for extensive approval timelines, restricting land development and proposed uses, and subject to appeals and litigation, all of which could tie up a project indefinitely. Directs state agencies to identify additional permitting requirements, including provisions of the California Building Code, that can safely be suspended or streamlined to accelerate rebuilding and make it more affordable. These state agencies, including Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation, the Office of Emergency Services (OES), and the Department of General Services (DSG), need to report to the Governor within 30 days on other permitting requirements that could \u201cunduly impede\u201d efforts to rebuild properties damaged in the fire, updating the report every 60 days to identify other requirements acting as barriers. HCD will coordinate with local governments to recommend procedures to establish rapid permitting and approval processes to expedite the reconstruction or replacement of residential properties, with the ultimate goal of issuing all necessary permits and approvals within 30 days. Extends protections against price gouging under Penal Code section 396(b)-(c) on building materials, storage services, construction, emergency clean-up and other essential goods and services associated with repair and reconstruction to January 7, 2026, in Los Angeles County. Commits the executive branch to working with the Legislature to identify statutory changes that can help expedite rebuilding while enhancing wildfire resilience and safety. Allows property owners to transfer the base year value of property that is substantially damaged or destroyed by the disaster to the rebuilt property, which could offer a significant tax savings. While EO N-4-25 has been heralded as \u201creally positive\u201d and \u201cas an admission we can safely build housing without [the constraints of these two intensive environmental laws]\u201d by industry leaders, including the California Building Association,[4] questions regarding the implementation of this order remain. For example, the order states that eligible projects must be substantially the same size and location, but leaves the door open as to whether the use can change. Would the order still apply if the redevelopment changed the use from single-family to a single-family home with an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) or denser residential or commercial uses? Additionally, EO N-4-25 is silent on the rebuilding or repair of infrastructure supporting the projects eligible for application of the executive order. If infrastructure cannot be installed quickly to support the other redevelopment, it is possible the success of such eligible redevelopment is hindered by the inability to utilize the new structures due to lack of services and access. Moreover, redevelopment projects under EO N-4-25 will still need to comply with local zoning and permitting ordinances. Therefore, redevelopment projects may still need to obtain discretionary approvals (i.e., conditional use permit, coastal development permit, site plan review), which are time- and resource-consuming even without the application of CEQA or the Coastal Act. Lastly, the state executive order creates a tension with Local Coastal Programs (LCP) for applicable areas (i.e., Malibu), which are at risk of being decertified by the California Coastal Commission if the local governments approve building plans contrary to approved LCPs. Additionally, as of late, one of the most popular issues subject to CEQA challenges has been wildfire danger. EO N-4-25 will likely be at odds with recent case law that sets the requirements for analyzing a project\u2019s impacts on evacuation routes and wildfire risk, including People of the State of California ex rel Rob Bonta Attorney General v. County of Lake (2024) __ Cal.App.5th __. Given CEQA\u2019s requirements for a fire risk analysis and the trend of recent caselaw, local governments \u2013 in order to avoid liability imposed by the courts \u2013 may be hard-pressed to approve projects without some sort of discretionary consideration given to the redevelopment\u2019s impacts on fire risk and evacuation routes. Only time will tell if the Governor\u2019s Office will issue clarifications to EO N-4-25 that address these and other uncertainties. LA EEO1 The executive order issued by Mayor Bass will: Coordinate debris removal from all impacted areas, mitigates for wet weather. This will create task forces to develop a streamlined program for debris removal and mitigate risks from rain storms, uniting with the OES and other City, County, state and federal agencies. Clear the way to rebuild homes as they were. This will establish a one-stop-shop to swiftly issue permits in all impacted areas, directs City departments to expedite all building permit review/inspections, bypasses state CEQA discretionary review, allows rebuilding \u201clike for like\u201d and waives City discretionary review processes. The City has already established a Disaster Recovery Center to serve individuals and families impacted by the fire in the Pacific Palisades, which is open 7 days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. at: 10850 Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90064 Make 1,400 units of in progress housing units available. LA EEO1 directs the Department of Building and Safety to issue temporary certificates of occupancy for 1,400 housing units currently in the pipeline across the City. Establish a framework to secure additional regulatory relief and resources. This instructs all City departments to report back in one week with a list of additional relief needed from state and federal regulations and requirements, as well as state and federal funding needed for recovery. Expedite permit review and eliminate the discretionary review and other processes for \u201celigible projects.\u201d An eligible project is defined as one that repairs, restores, demolishes, or replaces a structure or facility substantially damaged or destroyed by wildfires that meets certain criteria, including: (i) the structure or facility is in substantially the same location as the original structure or facility; (ii) the structure or facility does not exceed 110% of the floor area, height, and bulk of the original structure or facility; (iii) maintaining the same use, intensity, and density of the original structure or facility, i.e., no new ADUs or changes of use; and (iv) obtaining building permits for repair or reconstruction within 7 years from the date of the order. Building permit review timelines by all City departments (including Department of Water and Power) must be completed in 30 days from the submission of a \u201ccomplete application.\u201d Discretionary review processes are waived for eligible projects, including, but not limited to the Pacific Palisades Village Specific Plan and Pacific Palisades Village Design Review Board Guidelines. The City must review applications submitted using the streamlined ministerial review processes under Senate Bill 35 (SB 35) (Govt. Code \u00a7 65913.4). While ambiguous, it appears that while Mayor Bass is technically waiving discretionary permitting requirements, applicants may still have to file applications with the Planning Department and go through a \u201cstreamlined\u201d entitlement process. In other words, the discretionary approvals would be processed ministerially and have the statutory review timelines for SB 35 projects, which would be 90 days from date of submittal for approval for projects less than 150 units and 180 days for projects greater than 150 units. In practice, these timelines are much longer given tribal notification requirements and preapplication forms and processes.Haul routes for eligible projects shall be approved ministerially without noticing, hearings, findings, or appeals.Clarifies that eligible projects are exempt from requirements to obtain a Coastal Development Permit under Coastal Act section 30610(g).Application of the All-Electric Building Code (Ordinance No. 187714) does not apply to eligible projects.Demolition permits are not required for structures, improvements, or facilities substantially damaged or destroyed by the wildfires. Tiny homes, modular structures and mobile homes, are permitted for up to 3 years on the site during rebuilding. Similar to the fires, State and local response to recent events is rapidly evolving.

Listen To This Post FOOTNOTES [1] Such proclamation triggers, among other things, the enforcement of price-gouging restrictions. Please see here for an article with more information. [2] Government Code \u00a7 8571 authorizes the Governor to suspend regulatory statutes during a state of emergency upon determining that strict compliance \u201cwould in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency.\u201d [3] LA EEO1 will only apply to projects within the City of Los Angeles, but not those destroyed outside the City\u2019s jurisdictional boundaries like those destroyed by the Eaton Fire in Altadena.",

          "raw_content": "While the exact causes of the ongoing Los Angeles fires are still under investigation, there is no doubt over the role California\u2019s climate played in exacerbating the fires, fueling their rapid intensification and spread. \u2014 The ongoing, wind-fed LA fires have killed at least 24 people and swept through 40,000 acres in the greater Los Angeles area \u2013 an area larger than San Francisco \u2013 destroying entire communities and more than 12,300 structures. Meanwhile, millions of people are being exposed to dangerous wildfire smoke as toxins from burning homes, cars, chemicals, plastics and fuels fill the air. California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC News on Sunday that the fires were likely to be the worst natural disaster in US history \u201cin terms of just the costs associated with it.\u201d Over the weekend, private forecaster AccuWeather increased its preliminary estimate of financial losses from the blazes from $250 billion to $275 billion. For days, experts have talked about \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of climate conditions that have fueled the devastating fires. Earth.Org takes a closer look. 1. It is the first time that LA sees \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire weather in January It is now clear that a lethal combination of high temperatures and very low humidity, dry vegetation, and strong offshore Santa Ana winds has fuelled the deadly LA fires, allowing them to grow and spread much faster than they could be contained. For context, very fast fires are responsible for more than 75% of the structures that burned in the US from 2001 to 2020. For Douglas Kelley, a land surface modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, these multiple factors creates \u201ca perfect storm\u201d for the wildfires to grow. But while the Santa Ana winds \u2013 dry, warm winds originate from the western desert interior of the US and push towards southern California \u2013 are typical for this time of year, the abundance of dry vegetation isn\u2019t. As meteorologist Eric Holthaus explained, \u201cThe National Weather Service defines \u2018extremely critical\u2019 fire weather as sustained winds in excess of 30 mph and relative humidity of less than 10% in the presence of drought conditions and temperatures warmer than 70 degrees. This is the first time in history these criteria have been met anywhere in the United States during the month of January.\u201d Speaking with The Atlantic, Glen MacDonald, a geography professor at UCLA, said the concept of fire season no longer applies to Southern California. \u201cYou can have a fire any month of the year,\u201d he remarked last week. 2. California is in a drought When the fires started on January 7, Los Angeles County was tinder dry after experiencing its hottest summer in at least 130 years and receiving only 0.16 inches (4.1mm) of rain since last May. Overall, Southern California is currently experiencing \u201cabnormally dry\u201d conditions following two winters of heavy rainfall in 2022 and 2023, with nearly 2.2 million people living in areas affected by a drought. The region typically sees the bulk of its precipitation between October and April. \u201cYou\u2019d have to go to the late 1800s to see this dry of a start to the rainy season,\u201d MacDonald told The Atlantic last week. Much of Los Angeles County is currently under \u201csevere drought\u201d conditions, with soil moisture in the area in the bottom 2% historically for this time of year, according to NASA. When prolonged dry spells occur, vegetation becomes parched and highly flammable, transforming forests and grasslands into tinderboxes waiting to ignite. The scarcity of moisture not only dries out plants but also increases the likelihood of human activities, lightning strikes, or other ignition sources sparking fires. Once a fire starts in these arid conditions, it can spread rapidly and uncontrollably due to the abundance of dry fuel and low humidity levels typical of drought-stricken areas.

Climate change is influencing fire activity in North America Climate change is amplifying extreme weather events, including wildfires. Both the frequency and intensity of wildfires have more than doubled in the last two decades, as more frequent hot, dry, and windy conditions create the perfect fuel. And when the ecological, social and economic consequences of wildfires were accounted for, six of the last seven years were the most \u201cenergetically intense.\u201d Rising global temperatures, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, have contributed to an increase in \u201cfire weather\u201d days by drying out vegetation and soils and lowering humidity levels. Globally, wildfire seasons are now roughly two weeks longer, on average, mostly by enhancing the availability of fuel through heat and dry conditions. The average wildfire season in Western US is now 105 days longer, burns six times as many acres, and sees three times as many large fires \u2013 fires that burn more than 1,000 acres compared to the 1970s, according to non-profit Climate Central. In California, researchers have linked the climate emergency to a 172% increase in burned areas since the 1970s, with projections indicating a continued spread of wildfires in the years to come. Climate change has also increased the risk of extreme daily wildfire in the state by 25% on average, a 2023 study pointed out. 19 of the 20 largest wildfires in the state\u2019s history have occurred since 2003 and half of them in the past five years, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cThese devastating fires are not only occurring with greater intensity but are also striking earlier than Southern California\u2019s typical fire season, highlighting how climate change is reshaping fire regimes \u2013 the characteristic patterns of wildfire in a region,\u201d said Kimberley Simpson, a fellow in nature-based climate solutions at the University of Sheffield\u2019s School of Biosciences.
