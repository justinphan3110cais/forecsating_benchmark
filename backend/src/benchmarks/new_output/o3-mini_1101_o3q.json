Originally passed in 1963, the CAA has been [amended numerous times](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/evolution-clean-air-act). The CAA prevents states from imposing their own emissions regulations for new vehicles, with an exception that states [which had imposed vehicle emissions regulations prior to March 30, 1966](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30853) may apply for a waiver to enforce their own emissions regulations contingent on the regulations being more stringent than the national regulations, along with several other conditions.\n\nAs the only state meeting the date requirement, California is uniquely positioned to adopts its own emissions regulations. Additionally, the [CAA permits other states](https://www.epa.gov/state-and-local-transportation/vehicle-emissions-california-waivers-and-authorizations#:~:text=subpart%20B%2C%20%C2%A7%201074.105.-,State%20Adoption%20of%20California%20Standards,-The%20Clean%20Air) to adopt, without federal review, emissions regulations imposed by California which have been granted a waiver by the EPA.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board (CARB) [says the following](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/california-waiver-facts) about the history of its waiver applications (emphasis theirs):\n\n>**No waiver has ever been revoked and the one previous denial was quickly reversed.** There is no Clean Air Act process for revoking a waiver \u2013 which makes sense because governments and industry rely on waivers for years after they are granted to deliver clean vehicles and develop clean air plans. Even waiver denial is incredibly rare. The one time this occurred, in 2008, the U.S. EPA initially denied California\u2019s waiver for GHG emission standards for 2009 and later model year light-duty motor vehicles. That denial was reversed when the U.S. EPA reconsidered it, and ultimately granted it.\n\nDetails about prior waivers are available at [this EPA page](https://www.epa.gov/state-and-local-transportation/vehicle-emissions-california-waivers-and-authorizations).",

It is a once-daily injected drug based on the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), whose biology has turned out to be a goldmine for the medical management of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide, which was developed by Novo Nordisk, causes about\u00a0[7%](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61375-1)\u00a0[loss](https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2011.158)\u00a0of body weight in people with obesity when paired with diet and exercise advice.\n\nBy tweaking the design of GLP-1-based drugs,\u00a0[Novo Nordisk discovered](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b00726)\u00a0another drug that had a much longer half-life in the blood and a substantially larger impact on body weight: semaglutide.

It's marketed under the brand name Wegovy in the US, and Ozempic or Rybelsus in other markets.\n\nGiven the checkered history of weight loss drugs, it's reasonable to be cautious about their safety. Semaglutide and related drugs often cause unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, and headache, but these are typically mild and transient if the dose is started low and escalated slowly.\u00a0[Few people](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183)\u00a0discontinue semaglutide due to side effects.\n\nSome studies have suggested that this class of drugs may increase the risk of\u00a0[thyroid](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2009-1272)\u00a0and\u00a0[pancreatic](https://doi.org/10.2337/db11-1109)\u00a0cancer in lab rodents. Yet\u00a0[randomized controlled trials](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-019-02055-z)\u00a0including 64,000 people with type 2 diabetes have not observed an increased risk of cancer, overall or at any specific site in humans. These trials are limited in duration and don't yet have enough people to reliably identify modest increases in the risk of low-frequency outcomes like thyroid and pancreatic cancer. Observational\u00a0[monitoring data](https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.645563)\u00a0are mixed but have not provided a clear signal of increased risk.\n\nImportantly, trials suggest that semaglutide\u00a0[reduces major](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1901118)\u00a0[cardiovascular events](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141)\u00a0by about one quarter, similar to cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. Furthermore, across seven trials in people with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide and related drugs reduce the overall risk of dying\u00a0[by 12%](https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-8587(19)30249-9).

Neither do all Russians celebrate Christmas in December. These differences are irrelevant for the question, which is focused on Christmas as celebrated by most cultures around the northern Atlantic.\n\n----\n\nThis question uses METAR data as the source for convenience, because it provides a standardised view into actual observed weather at diverse geographical locations.

    "question": "Will the Russian government officially ban YouTube before January 1, 2025?",
    "background_text": "As Moscow has cracked down on independent Russian-language media since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube has remained a key platform for opposition figures and dissenting voices. However, recent reports of mass outages and slowdowns of the video-sharing platform in Russia have raised concerns about its future in the country.\n\nRussian lawmakers have [blamed Google](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/youtube-slowdown-russia-darkens-freedom-speech-outlook-2024-08-08/), which owns YouTube, for failing to upgrade its equipment in Russia since the invasion, leading to the slowdown that started in mid-July 2024. They claim that the degradation of service is a necessary step to persuade YouTube to reinstate blocked Russian channels. However, Google and technology experts dispute this explanation.\n\nA recent [Russian-language article](https://news.ru/russia/kogda-youtube-zarabotaet-normalno-v-rossii-chto-dlya-etogo-nuzhno/) discussed how this ban could still be in the works (translated by Google Translate):\n\n>According to the chairman of the Digital Economy Development Fund, German Klimenko, YouTube will be blocked in Russia in three to five months.\n\n>\"I think that testing is underway. YouTube's fate is probably predetermined, and it is similar to Instagram's fate (operations are prohibited in the Russian Federation). I would assume that YouTube will hang around for three to five months, and then be blocked,\" he said in a conversation with [aif.ru](https://aif.ru/society/web/-sudba-youtube-reshena-german-klimenko-o-durove-youtube-i-ii-v-seti).\n\nAdditionally:\n\n>Deputy Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Boris Chernyshov told NEWS.ru that large-scale work is currently underway to increase the capacity of Russian video hosting sites: Rutube, VK video and others, which should replace the American video hosting.\n\n>\"This can be seen from the strong advertising campaign of domestic services. And due to the decline in the quality of the YouTube service, which is currently working intermittently, many bloggers, presenters, and authors have begun to transfer their content to Russian platforms and duplicate all new releases there by default,\" Chernyshov said.\n\nHowever, Chernyshov subsequently [said](https://lenta.ru/news/2024/09/21/deputat-ob-yasnil-zayavlenie-o-polnoy-blokirovke-youtube-v-rossii/) he was misquoted.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and YouTube continue to escalate, this question aims to assess whether the Russian government will take the drastic step of officially banning the platform before January 1, 2025.",

Hydrazine is one of the high performance monopropellants with low flame temperature, which makes it an efficient propellant. However, its toxicity to humans and environment has put, firstly, an economic burden on using such propellant during various development and operation phases. Secondly, an ethical burden toward the environment if such sense to be considered. It is worthy to note that hydrazine is not just an appealing efficient propellant for Space-use, but it is also seems to take a critical role in aeronautical military applications [such as fueling the auxiliary power units](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084802/http:/oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA065595) of the F-16 fighters and Eurofighter Typhoon.\n\nSpeaking of today in 2021/2022 and from a technical point of view, the economical as well as the environmental hazards concerns are taken seriously into account when considering \u2018space mission analysis & design.\u2019 The latter two aspects when coupled are crucial during the conceptualization of a given space mission as well as developing modern spacecraft critical components such as the propulsion systems.\n\nBasically, space industry is currently oriented toward adopting the so-called \u2018Green Propellants.\u2019 A very simple technical definition for Green Propellants can state that the propellants possessing no (or very marginal) health concerns or environmental hazards either in storage, transportation, or operation phases of a project lifecycle, are considered to be \u2018green\u2019 \u2013 this would opt out propellants with high-toxicity like hydrazine, but fossil hydrocarbons are not yet considered \u2018non-green\u2019 fuels in the framework of Space propulsion applications in contrary to fuels in automobile industry. More detailed technical definitions can be referenced in the these academic articles: [Article 1](http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-71f98242-5541-4f80-a02b-8b601f7fe31b), [Article 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/8/1/20/htm#B3-aerospace-08-00020).\n\nCurrent Green Propellants industry is reaching maturity that several global research efforts have already provided commercially available and space-tested green propellants. Examples are: the US Air Force developed propellant AF-M315E (currently known and commercialized as [ASCENT](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/green/gpim-nears-completion.html)); the European [LMP-103S](https://www.ecaps.space/hpgp-performance.php) developed by Bradford ECAPS; and the Japanese [HNP-family](https://encyclopedia.pub/7693) of green monopropellants developed by [IHI Aerospace Co., Ltd](https://www.ihi.co.jp/ia/en/products/space/pinot/pinot-g/en/index.html). These propellants are suitable for spacecraft use in in-space propulsion, usually for the [small spacecraft class](https://www.nasa.gov/smallsat-institute/sst-soa-2020). \n\nThere were rumors among the aerospace European community ([particularly since 2017](https://spacenews.com/hydrazine-ban-could-cost-europes-space-industry-billions/)) that EU would ban completely the use of hydrazine by 2021, so far nothing is clear however about this intention.",

There has been [some discussion](https://decrypt.co/112420/cftc-dccpa-bill-leak-defi-regulation) about the effects of this bill on what has come to be called 'decentralised finance' (or DeFi), with some worrying that it may massively restrict this sector of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFurther, given the [bankruptcy of FTX](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy.html) (and its associated businesses), Sam Bankman-Fried's lobbying in Washington in favour of the DCCPA has raised concerns. At the same time, the FTX crash has also increased calls for regulation more broadly.

Bush [in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots#Day_3_\u2013_Friday,_May_1).\n\nRecent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, protests by both left-leaning and right-leaning movements, and the Capitol Hill attack, have raised the possibility of the Insurrection Act being invoked again.",

Many believe Biden's mental health is not good and may deteriorate fast ([see this question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4906/will-an-official-diagnosis-of-dementia-be-announced-for-joe-biden-before-2023/)). This opens the question of whether he will leave office due to mental health reasons before finishing his first term. In August 2020, there was a nation-wide poll on this: [59% Think Biden Unlikely to Finish A Four-Year Term in White House](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2020/59_think_biden_unlikely_to_finish_a_four_year_term_in_white_house).\n\n>Likely Democrat nominee Joe Biden is expected to announce his vice presidential running mate any day now, and most voters think it\u2019s likely that person will be president within the next four years if Biden is elected in November.\n\n>The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 59% of Likely U.S. Voters believe it\u2019s likely Biden\u2019s running mate will be president before the end of Biden\u2019s four-year term if he wins this fall, with 39% who say it\u2019s Very Likely. Thirty-five percent (35%) consider it unlikely that Biden\u2019s vice presidential choice will be president before his four-year term ends, but that includes only 14% who think it\u2019s Not At All Likely.\n\n>Even 49% of Democrats think it\u2019s likely Biden\u2019s vice president will become president in the next four years, although that compares to 73% of Republicans and 57% of voters not affiliated with either major party.",

    "background_text": "Since the beginning of its [ground operations in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip) in October 2023, Israel has repeatedly issued evacuation warnings for regions of Gaza, advising residents in those regions to move to designated humanitarian areas. According to a [BBC article published in May of 2024](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c299pl8j8w7o):\n\n> More than three-quarters of Gaza's territory have been designated as evacuation zones by the Israeli military since the war against Hamas began in October, an analysis by BBC Arabic has found.\n> \u00a0\n> The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued evacuation orders to Gazans since Israel launched a military campaign on 7 October in response to a cross-border attack that day by Hamas, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 people were taken hostage. The Israeli response has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n> \u00a0\n> The BBC\u2019s analysis shows the cumulative areas designated as evacuation zones amount to 281 sq km (108 sq miles). That is the equivalent of 77% of Gaza's territory.\n\nInitially focusing its ground operation on northern Gaza, Israel later expanded the operation to southern Gaza, and was [reported to have retreated from northern Gaza in July 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/12/middleeast/israeli-military-withdrawal-central-northern-gaza-palestinians-killed-intl/index.html). However, in October 2024, Israel [resumed operations in northern Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/middleeast/israel-military-push-northern-gaza-intl/index.html).\n\nThe conflict in Gaza and the resulting evacuations have [caused international concern about displaced Palestinians](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza). Concerns were elevated in early November 2024, when it was reported that Palestinians may not be allowed back to northern Gaza. [According to CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-offensive-beit-lahiya-idf-says-civilians-not-allowed-back/):\n\n> Briefing journalists Tuesday night, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, who commands the IDF's 162nd Division operating in Gaza, said that since troops had been forced to enter some areas twice, including the Jabaliya camp, \"there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes.\"\n\nHowever, [The Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/idf-israel-military-no-return-remarks-north-gaza) that the IDF distanced itself from that statement and that the comments had been taken out of context.\n\nThe IDF normally announces evacuation zones and humanitarian areas through its representatives, for example through [Avichay Adraee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avichay_Adraee), Head of the Arab Media Division of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. For example, see Adraee's posts on X from [October 8, 2024](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1843647422829879299) and [October 12, 2024](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844966449091100695/photo/1), stating areas which must be evacuated corresponding to the IDF's resumed push into northern Gaza. The posts include images depicting blocks within Gaza, corresponding to a [map of numbered blocks released by the IDF](https://www.idf.il/ar/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A/swordsofiron-011223-150/) (note, if the map is showing only blue you may need to zoom out, or alternatively open it in a private browsing window without location access).\n\nThe IDF has [stated that it is not forcibly displacing Palestinians](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/20/israel-northern-gaza-ultimatum-palestinians), saying in a [November 2024 letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25351674-response-letter-minister-dermer-and-minister-katz/):\n\n> Israel affirms that it had no and has no policy of forced evacuation of civilians from anywhere in the Gaza Strip, including northern Gaza. At no point has Israel issued \"Evacuation Orders\" anywhere in the Gaza Strip throughout the war. Rather, Israel warns the civilians population in a certain area, prior to operating in that area, in accordance with the Laws of Armed Conflict, and urges them to distance themselves from areas of intense hostilities.\n> \u00a0\n> No civilian is forced to leave, and the population that chooses to remain in these areas is taken into consideration in the operational planning, including the facilitation of humanitarian assistance.\n\nWhether and when Palestinian civilians will be able to safely return to northern Gaza remains an open question. In April 2024 it was reported that thousands of Palestinians attempted to return to northern Gaza, but [CNN reported that the IDF stated](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/palestinians-return-northern-gaza-intl-latam/index.html):\n\n> The northern Gaza Strip continues to be an active war zone and return to the area is not currently permitted.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

    "background_text": "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel):\n\n> On December 18, 2023, Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC), the world's third largest steel producer, entered a definitive agreement to purchase United States Steel Corporation (U.S. Steel) for $14.9 billion. Under the terms of the deal, U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of NSC but retain its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania \\[...].\n\n> The potential foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, which is widely considered an icon of American industry, has generated controversy in the U.S. The White House, lawmakers from both major parties, and the USW have criticized or opposed the deal due to concerns about its impact on workers, supply chains, and national security. Conversely, the transaction has garnered support from various government officials, policy experts, and business analysts, who argue that it will help revitalize U.S. Steel and the country's declining steel industry and counter that Japan is a major economic partner and investor.\n\n> On March 14, 2024, the Biden Administration announced its opposition to the planned acquisition, echoing a statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to block the deal \"instantaneously\" if elected president in the upcoming 2024 presidential elections. The deal is undergoing an antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice, and a possible investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Nippon Steel has subsequently delayed its timeline for closing the deal from the middle of 2024 towards the end of the year.\n\nCFIUS let the companies [refile their application](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-decision-nippons-bid-us-steel-pushed-back-until-after-election-2024-09-17/) in September, which sets a new deadline in December for the CFIUS to make a decision.",

[According to the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce):\n\n>AlphaCode was tested on 10 of challenges that had been tackled by 5,000 users on the Codeforces site. On average, it ranked within the top 54.3 percent of responses, and DeepMind estimates that this gives the system a Codeforces Elo of 1238, which places it within the top 28 percent of users who have competed on the site in the last six months.\n\nIn December of 2023, DeepMind announced AlphaCode 2, powered by its [new Gemini model](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/). In an [accompanying technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode2/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf), DeepMind described AlphaCode2 as a significant improvement over the first AlphaCode and said it performed better than 85% of competition participants on Codeforces.\n\n>When evaluated on the Codeforces platform \u2013 a mainstay of competitive programming \u2013 AlphaCode 2 solves 43% of problems within 10 attempts, close to twice as many problems as the original AlphaCode (25%). While its predecessor performed at the level of the median competitor, we estimate that AlphaCode 2 reaches the 85th percentile on average.\n\nSo far AlphaCode results appear to be based on a comparison of its performance to those of contestants without actually entering the contest.

Box Office Mojo generally [defines](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-mojo-by-imdbpro-faq/GCWTV4MQKGWRAUAP#domesticinternational) \"domestic\" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico).

Additional sources of revenue, such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, etc. are not included.\n\n>Gross refers to gross earnings in U.S. dollars. On average, a movie's distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the \"rentals\") with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e. movie theater). The money split varies from movie to movie, but, generally, the contract favors the distributor in early weeks and shifts to the exhibitor later on.\n\n>Weekend box office charts show gross receipts for a given weekend, which is Friday through Sunday unless otherwise noted. Studio estimates for the weekend are reported on Sunday mornings, generally between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific Time and reflect estimated Friday and Saturday box office receipts plus a projection for Sunday.",

So far, all the high temperature ambient pressure superconductors are based on cuprates or iron.\n\nEarly superconductors were all found at very low temperatures, and discoveries above 20K were not made until the 1970s. [High-temperature superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity) are usually defined as those with Tc above 77K, but even superconductors exceeding 30K are fairly unusual materials.\n\nOther superconductor families include metals and metal alloys, nickelates, carbon compounds (fullerenes, nanotubes, diamond, and doped relatives), and some high-pressure families. None of the ceramics and oxides include lead or phosphorous as major constituents.\n\nThe propose LK-99 structure is CuO25P6Pb9. It is almost entirely lead, oxygen, and phosphorus.\n\nOne of the many questions surround LK-99 is whether the described composition is correct, and in particular whether trace impurities are important. Variant recipes have been suggested, along with questions about replacing the copper with other elements.\n\nRather than asking whether LK-99 as described superconducts at room temperature, this question asks the much broader question of whether any related material superconducts at a much broader temperature range.",

This version has an extended resolution date.*\n\n---\n\nIn early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine), a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...91M/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...27G/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published [an update](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10103) to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.",

The legislation was driven by the efforts of Chris Cox, Republican congressman and former White House staffer for Ronald Reagan, who joined hands with Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden in an effort to allow then-nascent Internet service providers to moderate online discussions and suppress pornography and other content.  \n\nThe next year, the Supreme Court struck down most of the anti-porn provisions on freedom-of-speech grounds, and Section 230 was left as the main consequence of the new legislation: Internet providers, whether moderating content or not, were from then on fairly safe from lawsuits regarding any of the content they publish and any decisions on which users are allowed to publish.\n\nBacklash against Section 230 grew among Republicans and the right in the 2010s, as discussion groups and influential users with hundreds of thousands of followers, such as Yiannopoulos, were banned from platforms with no recourse. Democrats and the left also expressed significant concerns from the start of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency in 2017, following accusations that Facebook \u2013 in particular \u2013 was used to spread disinformation that benefited Trump\u2019s campaign. \n\nTrump launched [an effort to terminate Section 230](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/) in May 2020.

This decision led to a [lawsuit filed by several publishers](https://www.eff.org/cases/hachette-v-internet-archive) against the Internet Archive, alleging copyright violation. In March 2023, a lower court [ruled against](https://file770.com/judge-decides-against-internet-archive/) the Internet Archive, although they plan to [continue fighting the case](http://blog.archive.org/2023/03/25/the-fight-continues/).\n\nA judgment against the Internet Archive could be devastating, as it is a free website funded by donations and may lose a significant amount of money to the publishing houses seeking damages. Furthermore, publishers seem to oppose the [entire operation of the Internet Archive](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/10/24/as-big-book-publishers-look-to-kill-the-internet-archive-it-introduces-democracys-library/), from its public domain work to its Wayback Machine, which is the largest archive of the Internet in existence.",
