    "question": "Will a journalist or an opposition politician be charged in connection with the assassination attempt on Slovak PM Robert Fico before June 15, 2024?",
    "background_text": "On May 15th, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico (SMER-SD party) was targeted in an [assassination attempt](https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-prime-minister-shooting-fico-23faba11c0f371ef0f69a34861337ae0) after leaving a governmental meeting in the town of Handlov\u00e1. The assailant, Juraj Cintula, managed to fire at least five bullets from very close proximity before being subdued. Prime Minister Fico was urgently taken to the hospital; his [condition](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/slovakia-prime-minister-robert-fico-shot/?intcid=CNR-02-0623) remains serious but stable.\n\nJust a few hours after the attack, the Deputy Chairman of the Slovak Parliament, \u013dubo\u0161 Blaho (SMER-SD party), in an emotional speech, blamed the [\"liberal media\"](https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/nejvetsi-radikalove-vladni-koalice-obvinili-z-atentatu-na-fica-media-a-opozici_2405151955_jgr) and the political opposition for inciting the shooter. Concurrently, Andrej Danko, leader of the SNS party, which is a member of the ruling coalition, echoed this sentiment.\n\nRobert Kali\u0148\u00e1k, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, has been the most prominent figure in the aftermath, with his statements also targeting the media and political opposition.\n\nOutgoing Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 and newly elected President Peter Pellegrini have called for societal calm and are orchestrating a [meeting](https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/caputova-a-pellegrini-vyzvali-k-opusteni-bludneho-kruhu-nenavisti/2519316) with all major political entities in Slovakia, scheduled for May 21. However, so far, all governmental parties have either not responded or declined the invitation.\n\nTo date, apart from the shooter, only one individual has been charged in connection with the assassination attempt, and it was for spreading online hate. Paradoxically, despite the framing by the governmental politicians, the shooter was no fan of the liberal opposition and reportedly also a member of the recently disbanded [\"Slovensk\u00ed Branci\"](https://www.euronews.com/2024/05/15/what-is-known-about-suspect-allegedly-involved-in-shooting-of-robert-fico) paramilitary group, which had ties to Russia.",

Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft.

Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

    "question": "Will Unit 4 of the Georgia Power Co Vogtle nuclear power plant be operational in May, 2024?",

The process is fraught with stringent regulatory requirements, high financial costs, advanced technological needs, and often public and political scrutiny. These challenges contribute to the rarity of new nuclear projects; for instance, Vogtle Unit 3 was the first new nuclear unit constructed in the U.S. in more than 30 years.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the progress of Georgia Power Co's Vogtle Unit 4 at Plant Vogtle near Waynesboro, Ga., is significant. [This unit has reached a crucial milestone with the commencement of fuel loading, an essential step towards its start up and commercial operation](https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/vogtle-unit-4-starts-nuclear-fuel-load.html). The successful construction and operation of Vogtle Unit 4, following the recent commissioning of Unit 3, reflect Georgia Power's commitment to expanding nuclear energy. This commitment is underscored by the unit's potential to provide reliable, emissions-free energy to a significant number of homes and businesses. However, the project isn't without its challenges, including managing construction costs, scheduling, and ensuring adherence to safety and regulatory standards.",

Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft. The company already has [a perpetual license to all OpenAI IP](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51) ([short of artificial general intelligence](https://openai.com/our-structure#:~:text=the%20board%20determines%20when%20we%27ve%20attained%20AGI.%20Again%2C%20by%20AGI%20we%20mean%20a%20highly%20autonomous%20system%20that%20outperforms%20humans%20at%20most%20economically%20valuable%20work.%20Such%20a%20system%20is%20excluded%20from%20IP%20licenses%20and%20other%20commercial%20terms%20with%20Microsoft%2C%20which%20only%20apply%20to%20pre%2DAGI%20technology.)), including source code and model weights; the question was whether it would have the talent to exploit that IP if OpenAI suffered the sort of talent drain that was threatened upon Altman and Brockman\u2019s removal. Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

    "question": "Will a new SARS-CoV-2 variant be classified as a Variant of Concern (VOC) or worse in the United States before March 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "The SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG), established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, coordinates between the CDC, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and Department of Defense. This group is responsible for classifying and monitoring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks [SARS-CoV-2 variants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-classifications.html) classified by the SIG. As of December 1, 2023, the CDC shows four variant classifications which describe the characteristics of certain variants for use in informing the public health response. The four classifications are described as follows:\n\n**Variants Being Monitored (VBM)**\n>. . . Variants designated as VBM include:\n>\n>* lineages with potential impact on available medical countermeasures based on analysis of genetic sequence data.\n>* lineages that previously caused more severe disease or increased transmission but that are no longer detected.\n>* lineage with an unusually large number of antigenic mutations AND presence in multiple countries with collection dates within 4 weeks.\n>*lineages previously designated as a VOI, VOC, or VOHC that are currently circulating at very low levels in the United States.\n>\n>A Variant of Interest or a Variant of Concern may be downgraded to this list after it is no longer circulating at sustained levels and no longer poses significant risk to public health in the United States. Classifications may change over time, based on the evolving situation and information available.\n\n**Variant of Interest (VOI)**\n>. . . Variants designated as VOI include variants that have:\n>\n>* reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced efficacy of FDA approved treatments, or diagnostic tests.\n>* predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.\n>\n>Possible attributes of a Variant of Interest include:\n>\n>* specific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.\n>* evidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.\n\n**Variant of Concern (VOC)**\n>. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of interest, variants designated as VOC include:\n>\n>* increase in transmissibility.\n>* more severe disease (for example, increased hospitalizations or deaths).\n>* significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\n\n**Variant of High Consequence (VOHC)**\n>A VOHC has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of concern, variants designated as VOHC include impact on MCMs such as:\n>\n>* demonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets.\n>* evidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease.\n>* significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple EUA or approved therapeutics.\n>* more severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.\n\nThe variant class hierarchy is described by the CDC as follows:\n\n>Each variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI). . . U.S. classifications may differ from the WHO classifications because the impact of variants may differ by location.\n\nAs of December 1, 2023, only \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" is classified as a VOC. All other variants are classified as VBM, except for \"variants containing the F456L spike mutations\" which is classified as a VOI. Previously the only variants to have reached the level of VOC were Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron, though all but \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" have since been downgraded.",

Since then, the Conservatives have maintained control of Parliament.  One of the key issues over the last decade was Britain's relationship with the European Union and its policies on immigration, with Conservatives ultimately paving the way for Brexit, while the Labour Party and other left-wing groups favored remaining.\n\nConservative leadership has been divided in recent years.  In spite of this apparent weakness, Labour has also lacked a key leader, and the rise of the Scottish National Party, which shares appeal with Labour (their founder was Scottish), has led to a loss of most seats from Labour to the SNP.  Some Scottish constituencies have experienced vote-splitting between Labour and the SNP, allowing Conservatives to gain seats there.\n\nCurrently, British law requires that the next general election be held [no later than January 28, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election).",

Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

If either of the top 2 placed finishers have already qualified through the two proceeding paths, the next highest-placed finisher at the Grand Swiss will qualify instead.\n- 1 Spot goes to the highest place finisher of the [2023-2024 FIDE Circuit](https://wcc.fide.com/fide_circuit.phtml) who hasn't already qualified through the proceedings paths (i.e. even though Fabiano Caruana is guaranteed to finish first in the circuit, he qualified through the World Cup path, and so the second place player from the circuit will likely qualify instead, unless the happen to finish in the top 2 of the Grande Swiss). \n- 1 Spot to the top rated player in the [FIDE rankings](https://ratings.fide.com/top_lists.phtml?list=open) who hasn't qualified through any of the other paths, provided the player has played at least 4 classical time control tournaments eligible for the 2023 FIDE Circuit.",

The most recent [visit](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/04/10/moldovas-restive-gagauzia-region-mulls-using-russian-payment-cards/) occurred on the 8th of April, and before that on the 6th of March, during which she [met](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/03/07/pro-moscow-governor-of-moldovas-gagauzia-seeks-putins-help/) with Russian President Vladimir Putin (edit May 6, 2024: Gu\u021bul also appears to have been in Moscow when this question was launched, with a [meeting in Moscow on April 22](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldova-brings-criminal-case-against-pro-russian-gagauzia-leader-court-2024-04-24/) and on [April 24](https://twitter.com/EvgheniaGutul/status/1783236723297685785)).\n\nIn the aftermath of both visits Russia promised to \"protect\" Gagauzia and also to distribute monthly [payments](https://cepa.org/article/the-kremlin-decides-to-buy-a-population/) to Gagauzian civil servants and senior citizens (together accounting for approximately 25,000 people).\n\nMore Gu\u021bul visits in Russia might signal rapid development in this region, which could mean further deterioration of the relationship between Gagauzia and Moldovan government.",

The company already has [a perpetual license to all OpenAI IP](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51) ([short of artificial general intelligence](https://openai.com/our-structure#:~:text=the%20board%20determines%20when%20we%27ve%20attained%20AGI.%20Again%2C%20by%20AGI%20we%20mean%20a%20highly%20autonomous%20system%20that%20outperforms%20humans%20at%20most%20economically%20valuable%20work.%20Such%20a%20system%20is%20excluded%20from%20IP%20licenses%20and%20other%20commercial%20terms%20with%20Microsoft%2C%20which%20only%20apply%20to%20pre%2DAGI%20technology.)), including source code and model weights; the question was whether it would have the talent to exploit that IP if OpenAI suffered the sort of talent drain that was threatened upon Altman and Brockman\u2019s removal. Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

Voters have also filed lawsuits in Florida and Michigan on the issue. Legal battles are widely expected, and these disputes might reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThis question focuses on whether these and similar ongoing discussions and legal challenges will result in Donald Trump being removed from the primary election ballot of any state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15th, 2024, the planned start of the 2024 Republican National Convention.",

A crompouce is a hybrid between a croissant and the traditional Dutch pastry [tompouce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompouce). News outlets attribute the hype to TikTok. Many local bakeries jumped in on the hype and started selling crompouces, [as did supermarket chain Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi567589/ah-crompouce). On the other hand, Hema (one of the most iconic stores that sell the traditional tompouce) started a humorous campaign that rejects the crompouce and advertises their classic tompouce. In [an interview published by newspaper AD on November 5th](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/crompouce-leidt-tot-weerstand-in-bakkerswereld-je-kunt-overal-wel-room-tussen-stoppen~adee2d7a/), one baker said \u201cI predict the hype is over in a few weeks\u201d.\n\nIs the crompouce a fad, or is it here to stay?",

This would include TikTok, currently owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company.\n\nThe bills also create a process for apps to remain on US app stores and web hosting services if they sever ties to entities subject to the control of a foreign adversary through divestment.

    "background_text": "In October 2022, Elon Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter for [$44 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html), transitioning the company from a public to a [private entity](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/technology/twitter-changes.html#:~:text=Making%20Twitter%20a%20private%20company,tightly%20controlled%20by%20an%20owner.). This change represents a significant shift in the company's structure and governance. Public companies, like Twitter was previously, are subject to strict disclosure requirements and shareholder scrutiny, with their shares traded on public stock exchanges. In contrast, a private company like Twitter under Musk's ownership is not obligated to disclose as much information and its shares are not publicly traded. This transition to a private structure grants Musk more control over the company's operations and strategic direction, allowing for potentially more rapid and significant changes in policies and practices. However, the long-term impact of this privatization on Twitter's operational and financial performance remains to be seen, as it introduces new dynamics in terms of management, debt obligations, and strategic vision implementation.",

    "question": "Will Macky Sall step down as president of Senegal at or before the currently scheduled end of his term?",
    "background_text": "Senegal was [scheduled to hold presidential elections on February 25, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Senegalese_presidential_election), but on February 5 Senegalese President [Macky Sall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macky_Sall) announced that the elections would be [delayed until December](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/05/africa/senegal-parliament-debates-extending-presidents-mandate-intl/index.html). The delayed vote has led to [protests and unrest](https://news.yahoo.com/ahead-planned-march-over-vote-122105603.html), as well as a state crackdown against the protests.\n\nSall's term is scheduled to end on April 2, 2024, and the delayed elections have [led to uncertainty regarding whether Sall will respect the term limit](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68253255).\n\nSenegal is in the geographical region of Africa that has seen a high rate of coups the past three years. Despite this, Senegal had previously maintained some stability and helped coordinate responses against coups elsewhere in the region.\n\nYet when Sall was [interviewed by *The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/26/senegals-president-asks-if-democracy-can-work-in-africas-coup-belt) in October 2023 he asked,\n\n> \"Is democracy as we want to do it really suitable?\"\n\nPreviously there had been a damaging fight between the incumbent president and an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko. The Economist wrote,\n\n> The fight centres around the question of whether Senegal\u2019s government is trying to tilt the election by using the courts to keep Mr Sonko off the ballot.\n\nThis has involved accusations of rape (acquitted), corruption of youth (convicted), plotting an insurrection (still active). The opposition claims this is repeating a pattern from 2019 when the opposition was also barred from running due to criminal convictions. The incumbent president denies this.\n\n> The charge and conviction sparked large protests, some of them violent, in support of Mr Sonko. The demonstrations were also fuelled by hints from Mr Sall that he might try to run for a third presidential term, even though Senegal\u2019s constitution has a two-term limit. It was only in July that Mr Sall definitively said he would not seek office again, after more than two years of protests and at least 37 deaths, according to Amnesty International, a rights group.\n\n> Mr Sall\u2019s announcement led to a lull in the violence, though it lasted less than a month until Mr Sonko was once more arrested. The government also dissolved his political party, Pastef, and arrested many of its leaders, including several mayors. As protests flared, the government cut mobile-internet access for almost a week.\n\nThere seems to be insecurities around how peaceful Senegal's democracy really is:\n\n> Many fear more violence before the election, especially if Mr Sonko is definitively barred from running. Even Mr Sall prevaricates when asked if he expects the election to be peaceful. [...] Mr Sall bristles at the suggestion there has been a backsliding of democracy on his watch. \u201cThose who say that [there has been] are supporters of anarchy and chaos,\u201d he retorts. \u201cSenegal has no lessons in democracy to learn from anyone.\u201d",

    "background_text": "On November 17, 2023, OpenAI [announced that it had fired CEO Sam Altman](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired). Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft. The company already has [a perpetual license to all OpenAI IP](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51) ([short of artificial general intelligence](https://openai.com/our-structure#:~:text=the%20board%20determines%20when%20we%27ve%20attained%20AGI.%20Again%2C%20by%20AGI%20we%20mean%20a%20highly%20autonomous%20system%20that%20outperforms%20humans%20at%20most%20economically%20valuable%20work.%20Such%20a%20system%20is%20excluded%20from%20IP%20licenses%20and%20other%20commercial%20terms%20with%20Microsoft%2C%20which%20only%20apply%20to%20pre%2DAGI%20technology.)), including source code and model weights; the question was whether it would have the talent to exploit that IP if OpenAI suffered the sort of talent drain that was threatened upon Altman and Brockman\u2019s removal. Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

    "question": "Will Sir Lindsay Hoyle remain Speaker of the House of Commons until March 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "[Sir Lindsay Hoyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Hoyle) is a former Labour MP and the current speaker of the House of Commons in the UK. Unlike in the US, the speaker of the House of Commons in the UK is not a member of either party and is conventionally strictly non-partisan. \n\nOn the 21st of February 2024, he caused tremendous controversy and uproar amongst members of the Tory and SNP parties when, on the SNP's opposition day (a day where the SNP decides which issues are debated in the House of Commons) he selected the Labour amendment to the SNP's motion to be debated, in addition to the SNPs motion. This was controversial because the Tory government had also put forth an amendment for consideration, and long-standing precedent is that if the government puts forward an amendment, then only that amendment will be considered in addition to the original motion. \n\nMembers of the SNP expressed their fury with the decision, as it undermined their opposition day and as it posed the possibility of the house not being able to vote on the SNPs own motion on its opposition day. The Tory Party was upset because in addition to breaking with convention, the decision put many members of the government in a politically precarious position because it would likely result in the government's own amendment not being considered. As a result, the Tory Party abstained from both votes, and the SNP's motion and the Labour amendments passed unanimously without a division. \n\nIn statements in the House after the motion and amendment had passed, the leader of the SNP and Tory parties both expressed their concern over their parties to have confidence in the speaker's impartiality going forward.",

    "question": "Will Sweden join NATO before 2025?",
    "background_text": "NATO is an is an intergovernmental military alliance established in the aftermath of World War II.  During the Cold War, the main purpose of NATO was to provide collective security against the Soviet Union and its allies, the Warsaw Pact.  Recently, NATO has provided a European system of security against Russia, viewed by many in Europe as a hostile threat, especially after its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSweden was neutral throughout both World Wars.  However, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, its neighbor Finland, which also had [a longstanding policy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61397478) of neutrality, [joined NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_213448.htm).\n\nRecently, Sweden has applied to NATO.  NATO accession requires the unanimous consent of NATO members, and Turkey has [delayed](https://www.reuters.com/world/swedens-nato-bid-delayed-turkish-parliament-2023-11-16/) its vote on Sweden has NATO.  A [previous Metaculus question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10084/sweden-to-join-nato-before-2024/) asked if Sweden would join NATO before 2024.  Here, we ask if Sweden will join NATO before 2025.\n\nDisclaimer: I [sourced much of the description](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220301-ukraine-war-brings-sweden-finland-even-closer-to-nato) from here.",
