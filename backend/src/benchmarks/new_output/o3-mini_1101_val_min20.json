    "question": "Will someone hold their breath for more than 30 minutes before 2025?",
    "background_text": "The Guinness World Records reports that freediver Aleix Segura Vendrell currently (as of March 2018) holds the [world record for breath holding](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-time-breath-held-voluntarily-(male)), clocking in at a mind-numbing 24 minutes, 3:45 seconds on February 28, 2016.\n\nThat busted other previous records, such as magician David Blaine\u2019s impressive 17 minute breath hold. Amazing details on Blaine\u2019s feat are available in this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_blaine_how_i_held_my_breath_for_17_min) \n\nAll very nice. But bioengineering will allow us to push the record up\u2014possibily, way up. Some techniques, like \u201clung packing,\u201d are already being put to use by daredevils. [Per Deadspin](https://deadspin.com/how-long-can-humans-hold-their-breath-1467541916): \n\n> This [lung packing] consists of inhaling the very largest breath possible, and then, without exhaling, puffing your cheeks full of more air and attempting to force that air down into your lungs. You are literally stretching out your lungs so that they can hold more air.\n\nMore exotic ideas, like the so-called [\u201cAquaman Crystal\u201d](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-create-crystal-which-could-allow-us-to-breathe-underwater-9772871.html) are promising.\n\nSome extreme atheletes and freedivers are no doubt experimenting and [pushing the limits](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/11/nicholas_mevoli_freediving_death_what_happens_to_people_who_practice_holding.html).\n\nAnd there are documented cases on the record of people surviving without oxygen for long periods of time. As the [BBC reports](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140714-how-long-can-you-go-without-air):\n\n> When US toddler Michelle Funk fell into an icy stream in 1986, she survived an estimated 66 minutes underwater, preserved by deep hypothermia that reduced her metabolic rate to almost nothing.\n\nFunk\u2019s case was a freak accident. But by 2025 will a person voluntarily hold his or her breath for more than 30 minutes? (The attempt must comply with Guinness Record standards.)",

Neither do all Russians celebrate Christmas in December. These differences are irrelevant for the question, which is focused on Christmas as celebrated by most cultures around the northern Atlantic.\n\n----\n\nThis question uses METAR data as the source for convenience, because it provides a standardised view into actual observed weather at diverse geographical locations.

Critically for this question, there are also indications of precipitation. In the example above, that's \"-SN\" for \"light snow\".\n\nHere are some other examples of reports indicating snow:\n\n> METAR ESSA 270120Z 01005KT 9999 -SN SCT007 BKN009 OVC046 M05/M06 Q1010 RESN BECMG BKN020=`\n\nRESN means \"recent snow\"\n\n> METAR ESNU 252220Z 33009KT 9999 SG FEW018 OVC055 M03/M05 Q1003=\n\nSG means \"snow grains\"\n\n> METAR EFOU 041820Z AUTO 14003KT 9999 -SHSN SCT044 M13/M15 Q1013=\n\n-SHSN means \"light snow shower\"\n\nFor decoding reports, [the web tool by Flight Plan Database](https://flightplandatabase.com/METAR) can be a helpful assistant.",

    "background_text": "Influenza pandemics typically [come from](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2928832/) Influenza A, particularly from a sub-type against which much of the human population lacks much immunity. According [to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses-types.html):\n\n>Currently circulating influenza A(H1N1) viruses are related to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus that emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused a flu pandemic ([CDC 2009 H1N1 Flu website](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/)). These viruses, scientifically called the \"A(H1N1)pdm09 virus,\" and more generally called \"2009 H1N1,\" have continued to circulate seasonally since then and have undergone genetic changes and changes to their [antigenic properties](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/professionals/antigenic.htm) (i.e., the properties of the virus that affect immunity).\n\n>Influenza A(H3N2) viruses also change both genetically and antigenically. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have formed many separate, genetically different clades in recent years that continue to co-circulate.\n\nFor the 2024-25 flu season, the [trivalent](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/trivalent-vaccines-2024-2025.html) (three-component) vaccine will target two influenza A and one influenza B virus.

Among the 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations for the season, a disproportionate number (84.6%) were associated with influenza A, as compared with with 14.8% associated with influenza B.\n\nAccording [to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/overview/index.html):\n\n>All public health and clinical laboratories report each week to CDC the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number positive for influenza viruses, along with age or age group of the person, if available. CDC presents data from clinical laboratories that include the weekly total number of specimens tested for influenza, the number of positive influenza tests, and the percent positive by influenza virus type.\n\n>Influenza surveillance data are aggregated according to the week the event (e.g., positive laboratory test, outpatient visit, death) occurred. The week starts on Sunday and ends on the following Saturday. Each surveillance participant is requested to report its data to CDC by Tuesday afternoon of the following week. The data are then downloaded, compiled, and analyzed at CDC. [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/) and [FluView Interactive](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm) are updated weekly on Fridays. \n\nSince the pandemic, the numbers have been as follows:\n\n### FluView Week 18 (beginning of May) - Influenza A %\n\n| Season     | Influenza A % |\n|------------|---------------|\n| 2023-24    | 69.1%         |\n| 2022-23    | 98.2%         |\n| 2021-22    | 98.4%         |\n\nLooking at a wider sweep of history, during the 25 years through the 2023-24 season, 11 had two waves of influenza activity.

Neither do all Russians celebrate Christmas in December. These differences are irrelevant for the question, which is focused on Christmas as celebrated by most cultures around the northern Atlantic.\n\n----\n\nThis question uses METAR data as the source for convenience, because it provides a standardised view into actual observed weather at diverse geographical locations.

Critically for this question, there are also indications of precipitation. In the example above, that's \"-SN\" for \"light snow\".\n\nHere are some other examples of reports indicating snow:\n\n> METAR ESSA 270120Z 01005KT 9999 -SN SCT007 BKN009 OVC046 M05/M06 Q1010 RESN BECMG BKN020=`\n\nRESN means \"recent snow\"\n\n> METAR ESNU 252220Z 33009KT 9999 SG FEW018 OVC055 M03/M05 Q1003=\n\nSG means \"snow grains\"\n\n> METAR EFOU 041820Z AUTO 14003KT 9999 -SHSN SCT044 M13/M15 Q1013=\n\n-SHSN means \"light snow shower\"\n\nFor decoding reports, [the web tool by Flight Plan Database](https://flightplandatabase.com/METAR) can be a helpful assistant.",

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [has polled](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/texas/) in mid to high single digits in Texas, potentially stripping the Republican candidate of a majority of votes in the state.

The ability to sequence and identify nucleic acids from multiple different taxa for metagenomic analysis makes this a powerful new platform that can simultaneously identify genetic material from entirely different kingdoms of organisms.\n\nThe purpose of this question is to understand whether untargeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing will be utilized on a large scale in the US for pathogen identification.",

Examples include lethal effect to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, reactor core melt.\" The prime example of a \"major nuclear accident\" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\n\nThe situation regarding Russian control of Ukrainian nuclear reactors, particularly the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), has been a [focal point of concern](https://www.world-nuclear.org/ukraine-information/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy.aspx) since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The ZNPP, Europe's largest nuclear plant with six reactors, has been under Russian occupation since the early stages of the invasion in February 2022. The plant came under armed attack in March 2022, marking the first instance of an operating civil nuclear power plant being attacked during an active conflict. This attack led to a projectile hitting a training building and resulted in a fire, but essential equipment and the reactors remained unaffected\u200b\u200b.\n\nSince the conflict began, the [operation of the reactors has varied](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197574725/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-power-plants), with some being taken offline or put online as needed, depending on the stability of external power supplies and conditions around the plants\u200b\u200b.\n\n> There are six reactors at Zaporizhzhia maintained by Energoatom personnel, according to Kotin, but Russia controls the plant. Those reactors are currently offline. Meanwhile, Ukraine is operating nine reactors generating electricity at three other locations around the country.\n\nIn June 2023, Russia and Ukraine accused each other of [plotting to stage an attack on ZNPP](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-accuse-each-other-plotting-imminent-attack-nuclear-station-2023-07-04/).",

    "question": "Will the World Health Organization prequalify moxidectin before 2025?",
    "background_text": "In June 2024, GiveWell made a $637,549 grant to [Medicines Development for Global Health](https://www.medicinesdevelopment.com/) (MDGH), a not-for-profit pharmaceutical organization focused on developing medicines for neglected diseases in low- and middle-income countries, to complete the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) prequalification process for moxidectin.\n\nAccording to [the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis):\n\n>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as \u201criver blindness\u201d, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans through exposure to repeated bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium. Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness. More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The disease also exists in some foci in two countries in Latin America (the Yanomani area in Brazil and Venezuela) and Yemen.\n\nAs of September 2024, the WHO [recommends](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis) annual ivermectin treatments for 10-15 years to treat onchocerciasis. Ivermectin works by killing the larval worms or microfilariae and by temporarily stopping the adult female worms from producing more.\n\nHowever, ivermectin has some limitations, according to the [WHO](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/367431/9789240071469-eng.pdf), including resistance in some places and adverse reactions among people who also have Loa loa infection. According to the WHO, moxidectin is a safe and effective alternative that is effective for longer and has been shown in trials to reduce skin microfilariae more than in people treated with ivermectin. It may also be a more cost-saving treatment.\n\nIn 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [approved](https://tdr.who.int/activities/moxidectin-a-new-drug-for-ntds) moxidectin for treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals 12 years and older, making it the first new drug for onchocerciasis to be approved in the US in 20 years and worldwide in 30 years. \n\nHowever, the WHO has [unexpectedly required](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers) extensive extra clinical trials for moxidectin, casting its near term WHO prequalification (PQ) status into a level of uncertainty. PQ status [would help](https://www.medicinesdevelopment.com/our-work/medicines) get the medicine approved and licensed for usage in many countries. In its internal forecasting, GiveWell has assigned a 80% likelihood of moxidectin being prequalified before 2027.\n\nAccording to the [Global Health Council](https://globalhealth.org/member-spotlight-medicines-development-for-global-health/):\n\n>Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) is an independent biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of affordable medicines for the people who need them most. MDGH is a not-for-profit company that uses all funds in excess of running costs to develop medicines that address important unmet medical needs but may have limited commercial opportunities. \n\n>In June 2018, the FDA approved moxidectin for the treatment of the Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness), a devastating and debilitating microfilarial disease that causes intense itching, severe dermatitis and skin depigmentation. As the disease progresses it can also cause blindness, and this condition is the second-most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. 200 million people are estimated to be at risk from this disease, and its elimination is a longstanding goal for the WHO.\n\nSee Also:\n\n- Kura et al. (2023) - [Can mass drug administration of moxidectin accelerate onchocerciasis elimination in Africa?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0277) (PDF)\n- [Prequalification of medicines by WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/prequalification-of-medicines-by-who)\n- Global Health Council's member spotlight page for [Medicines Development for Global Health](https://globalhealth.org/member-spotlight-medicines-development-for-global-health/), Moxidectin's current license holder in the US.",

The infection marks the first reported case in humans the United States since an infection in Colorado in 2022.\n\n[CDC describes](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/reported-human-infections.htm) H5N1 infections in humans as follows:\n\n>HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 890 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 870  cases reported in 22 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported.

The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. [Total case counts reported](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) since 1997 are available.\n\nCDC maintains a [Current Situation Summary](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm) for H5N1 influenza, where as of April 11, 2024, detections in the US are listed as widespread for wild birds, sporadic for poultry flocks and mammals, and a total of two cases in humans in the US.

[According to CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-offensive-beit-lahiya-idf-says-civilians-not-allowed-back/):\n\n> Briefing journalists Tuesday night, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, who commands the IDF's 162nd Division operating in Gaza, said that since troops had been forced to enter some areas twice, including the Jabaliya camp, \"there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes.\"\n\nHowever, [The Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/idf-israel-military-no-return-remarks-north-gaza) that the IDF distanced itself from that statement and that the comments had been taken out of context.\n\nThe IDF normally announces evacuation zones and humanitarian areas through its representatives, for example through [Avichay Adraee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avichay_Adraee), Head of the Arab Media Division of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. For example, see Adraee's posts on X from [October 8, 2024](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1843647422829879299) and [October 12, 2024](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844966449091100695/photo/1), stating areas which must be evacuated corresponding to the IDF's resumed push into northern Gaza. The posts include images depicting blocks within Gaza, corresponding to a [map of numbered blocks released by the IDF](https://www.idf.il/ar/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A/swordsofiron-011223-150/) (note, if the map is showing only blue you may need to zoom out, or alternatively open it in a private browsing window without location access).\n\nThe IDF has [stated that it is not forcibly displacing Palestinians](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/20/israel-northern-gaza-ultimatum-palestinians), saying in a [November 2024 letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25351674-response-letter-minister-dermer-and-minister-katz/):\n\n> Israel affirms that it had no and has no policy of forced evacuation of civilians from anywhere in the Gaza Strip, including northern Gaza. At no point has Israel issued \"Evacuation Orders\" anywhere in the Gaza Strip throughout the war. Rather, Israel warns the civilians population in a certain area, prior to operating in that area, in accordance with the Laws of Armed Conflict, and urges them to distance themselves from areas of intense hostilities.\n> \u00a0\n> No civilian is forced to leave, and the population that chooses to remain in these areas is taken into consideration in the operational planning, including the facilitation of humanitarian assistance.\n\nWhether and when Palestinian civilians will be able to safely return to northern Gaza remains an open question. In April 2024 it was reported that thousands of Palestinians attempted to return to northern Gaza, but [CNN reported that the IDF stated](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/palestinians-return-northern-gaza-intl-latam/index.html):\n\n> The northern Gaza Strip continues to be an active war zone and return to the area is not currently permitted.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

    "background_text": "Boeing, one of two selected contractors for the [NASA Commercial Crew program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/) (the other being SpaceX), has developed its spacecraft, named *Starliner* to deliver astronauts to and from the ISS. \n\nUnfortunately, since inception, this Boeing program has been riddled with issues and delays. The [first orbital demo flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test), taking place in December 2019, was a failure as while the capsule was safely recovered, multiple serious issues during flight resulted in not completing mission objectives, such as reaching and docking with the ISS. \n\nDue to these issues, Boeing agreed to perform a [second orbital flight test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test_2) at \"no cost to the taxpayer\" with an estimated US$410 million out-of-pocket expenditure, and while this mission was nominally successful with the spacecraft docking to the ISS and returning safely, multiple serious issues were discovered both pre-launch--causing delays--and during operation including numerous failures of the maneuvering thruster system. \n\nThe latest flight of Starliner, the [crew flight test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crew_Flight_Test) launched in 2024 and gained massive media attention as failures in the thruster system resulted in the astronauts getting \"stranded\" aboard the ISS. After investigation, Boeing and NASA have decided to not risk returning the astronauts on the partially defective Starliner capsule, instead returning them on a different spacecraft. The defective Starliner will return to earth, unmanned. \n\nLooking towards the future, there is currently a planned [Starliner-1 mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1) in the \"fully operational phase\" of the Starliner Commercial Crew program, scheduled for no earlier than August, 2025. This mission, if it takes place, will begin a series of regular operational missions where Starliner transports four astronauts up to the ISS on a schedule. \n\nGenerally though, there are serious doubts about the future of the Boeing Starliner program. [For example, NASA has already double-booked the Starliner-1 Flight with the SpaceX-11 Flight](https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/starliner-passes-in-orbit-tests-but-first-operational-launch-slips/) in anticipation that Boeing will not be ready in time.\n\nThe technical issues, and more critically, the apparent inability of Boeing to fix known technical issues throw serious doubt upon Boeing's engineering skill and commitment to the program, making it likely that, for example, NASA insists on a fourth demo flight or potentially, Boeing decides to cut their losses and cancels the program.",

As an [offshoot](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kp2-now-dominant-covid-variant-experts-us-summer/story?id=110166187) of the [omicron variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant), KP (specifically KP.2 at the time) [first reached](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a1.htm) >10% prevalence in April 2024. KP.3.1.1 [became](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/kp-3-1-1-is-the-predominant-variant.html) the predominant variant in August 2024. \n\nRecently another new COVID variant has been rapidly [growing](https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2024/10/22/what-is-covid-19-variant-xec-spreading-in-pennsylvania/75794702007/) in the United States, the XEC variant, which is estimated at 17% according to the October 26th Nowcast. This is a sharp increase from the two-week period ended September 14, 2024, when it was 2%. Even at 17% following its rapid gains, XEC is still a distant second to KP.3.1.1, which is 57% according to the Nowcast. However, results from [one recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618773v1) \"suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1.\"\n\nAt the time of this question, CDC estimates variant proportions using two-week periods, using two different calculations: weighted estimates and Nowcast estimates. According [to CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions):\n\n>Weighted estimates (provided for all two-week periods except the most recent two, two-week periods) are variant proportions that are based on empirical (observed) genomic sequencing data. These estimates are not available for the most recent two-week periods because of the time it takes to generate the sequencing data, including sample collection, specimen treatment, shipping, analysis, and upload into public databases.\n\n>Lineages with weighted estimates less than 1% of all circulating variants are combined with their parent lineage. When the weighted estimate of a lineage crosses the 1% threshold and has substitutions in the spike protein that could affect vaccine efficacy, transmission, or severity, it may be separated from its parent lineage and displayed on its own in the variant proportions data.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n>Nowcast estimates (provided for the most recent two two-week periods when the \"Nowcast on\" option is selected below) are model-based projections of variant proportions for the most recent two-week periods to enable timely public health action. CDC uses the Nowcast to forecast variant proportions before the weighted estimates are available for a given two-week period.\n\nDue to the greater reliability,  verifiability, and empirical basis of the Weighted estimate, this question resolves based on that figure.",

Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Boozman (R-AR) officially introduced the [Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4760/text), a bill aimed at providing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies within the context of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The draft of this bill has been [leaked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1582814734587265024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582814734587265024%7Ctwgr%5E4a8506fcaf909a8b2ed867c4fcc7cac474f83c04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F112420%2Fcftc-dccpa-bill-leak-defi-regulation) in October 2022. \n\nAccording to [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2022/08/how-the-digital-commodities-consumer-protection-act-of-2022/), the central proposals of the DCCPA are:\n\n>Close regulatory gaps by requiring all digital commodity platforms (defined to mean a person that is one or more of the following: digital commodity broker, a digital commodity custodian, a digital commodity dealer, a digital commodity trading facility) to register with the CFTC\n\n>Require digital commodity platforms to prohibit abusive trading practices, eliminate or disclose conflicts of interest, maintain sufficient financial resources, have strong cybersecurity programs, protect customer assets and report suspicious transactions\n\n>Require digital commodity platforms to adhere to advertising standards and disclose information about digital commodities and their risks, bringing greater transparency and accountability to the marketplace\n\n>Authorize the CFTC to impose user fees on digital commodity platforms to fully fund its oversight of the digital commodity market\n\n>Direct the CFTC to examine racial, ethnic and gender demographics of customers participating in digital commodity markets and use that information to inform its rulemaking and provide outreach to customers and\n\n>Recognize that other financial agencies have a role in regulating digital assets that are not commodities, but function more like securities or forms of payment.\n\nThis proposed bill has been supported by several figures in the cryptocurrency industry, such as [Brian Armstrong](https://decrypt.co/111106/coinbase-very-supportive-cftc-bitcoin-ethereum) (Coinbase) and [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1582539579168419840?s=46&t=MIxvyFx75JEnEUfMnNt-Fw) (formerly of FTX). There has been [some discussion](https://decrypt.co/112420/cftc-dccpa-bill-leak-defi-regulation) about the effects of this bill on what has come to be called 'decentralised finance' (or DeFi), with some worrying that it may massively restrict this sector of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFurther, given the [bankruptcy of FTX](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy.html) (and its associated businesses), Sam Bankman-Fried's lobbying in Washington in favour of the DCCPA has raised concerns. At the same time, the FTX crash has also increased calls for regulation more broadly. Recently, both senators Stavenow (D-MI) and Boozman (R-AR) have said that the collapse of FTX showed [\"the need for greater federal oversight of the digital asset industry\"](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-senators-commit-to-advancing-crypto-bill-despite-ftx-collapse). \n\nAs of November 2022, there has not been a clear schedule as to when the bill will be published for the US Senate to review.",

Despite relatively high stocks from a historical standpoint, battery manufacturers also reportedly raised purchasing activity amid risks of a trade war after Trump assumes office next year in the US.

This version has an extended resolution date.*\n\n---\n\nIn early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine), a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...91M/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...27G/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published [an update](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10103) to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.",

This this is a sharp increase from the previous two-week period when it was 2.3%, though still a distant second to KP.3.1.1, a [descendant](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/3-things-to-know-about-xec-the-latest-covid-strain) of the FLiRT variants, which is at 57.2% according to the Nowcast (41.2% as of the latest weighted estimate). Results from [one recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618773v1) \"suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1.\"\n\nAt the time of this question, CDC estimates variant proportions using two-week periods, using two different calculations: weighted estimates and Nowcast estimates. According [to CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions):\n\n>Weighted estimates (provided for all two-week periods except the most recent two, two-week periods) are variant proportions that are based on empirical (observed) genomic sequencing data. These estimates are not available for the most recent two-week periods because of the time it takes to generate the sequencing data, including sample collection, specimen treatment, shipping, analysis, and upload into public databases.\n\n>Lineages with weighted estimates less than 1% of all circulating variants are combined with their parent lineage. When the weighted estimate of a lineage crosses the 1% threshold and has substitutions in the spike protein that could affect vaccine efficacy, transmission, or severity, it may be separated from its parent lineage and displayed on its own in the variant proportions data.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n>Nowcast estimates (provided for the most recent two two-week periods when the \"Nowcast on\" option is selected below) are model-based projections of variant proportions for the most recent two-week periods to enable timely public health action. CDC uses the Nowcast to forecast variant proportions before the weighted estimates are available for a given two-week period.\n\nDue to the greater reliability,  verifiability, and empirical basis of the Weighted estimate, this question resolves based on that figure.",

Mostly mild in cows (with most cows [reportedly](https://hoards.com/article-34969-how-will-avian-influenza-impact-milk-supply.html) being asymptomatic and most of those that get sick recovering within 3 weeks), HPAI primary affects [older cows](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00112-1/fulltext), leading to decreased milk production from an industry standpoint. While mortality in cows [is low](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/05/10/usda-hhs-announce-new-actions-reduce-impact-and-spread-h5n1), from a public health standpoint there is potentially a risk of spillover of H5N1 Influenza from cattle to humans, which might under certain circumstances lead to an epidemic. According to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, testing from the CDC [has found](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/studies-find-little-no-immunity-h5n1-avian-flu-virus-americans) that the American population has little to no pre-existing immunity to the H5N1 virus that is circulating on farms.\n\nH5N1 has been [detected in milk](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7321e1.htm) as well as being [spread to farm workers](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/protect-farm-workers-bird-flu.html). Therefore a potential useful line of defense in protecting human public health would be an H5 vaccine for dairy cows.\n\nIn May 2023, the US Department of Agriculture's Center for Veterinary Biologics (USDA-CVB) [began testing](https://www.avma.org/news/usda-starts-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-vaccine-trials) vaccines for HPAI. On August 28, 2024, it [expanded](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/cvb-notice-24-13-field-studies-nonviable-non-replicating-veterinary-vaccines) to authorize field trials. The advantage of field trials is that the studies are no longer required to  be conducted in containment facilities. For further details of the field studies authorization including protocols please see [CVB Notice NO. 24-13 (pdf)](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/notice24-13.pdf)\n\nThe USDA-CVB is [accepting applications](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/notice24-11.pdf) for the licensure of vaccines for livestock, including dairy cattle under the following pathways: \n\n>Conditional Licensure \u2013 CVB will consider serological response in vaccinated target species as data to support a reasonable expectation of efficacy. Serological testing should focus on antibodies to the H5 clade 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin using an assay such as or similar to the hemagglutination inhibition assay. \n\n>Full Licensure \u2013 Currently CVB will only consider studies using vaccinationchallenge with H5 HPAI in the target species, along with all other licensure requirements, to obtain full licensure. Note the recent [Select Agent Exemption for H5 HPAI](https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/exemptions/avian-influenza.htm). Study protocols should be submitted to CVB for review.\n\nAs of 11 November 2024, one company that has begun field trials is veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology company Medgene Labs, which [is expecting](https://kbhbradio.com/south-dakota-company-begins-trials-on-h5n1-avian-flu-vaccine-for-dairy-cows/) to complete its H5 vaccine study in December 2024 and share its results with the USDA at that time.",

[According to the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce):\n\n>AlphaCode was tested on 10 of challenges that had been tackled by 5,000 users on the Codeforces site. On average, it ranked within the top 54.3 percent of responses, and DeepMind estimates that this gives the system a Codeforces Elo of 1238, which places it within the top 28 percent of users who have competed on the site in the last six months.\n\nIn December of 2023, DeepMind announced AlphaCode 2, powered by its [new Gemini model](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/). In an [accompanying technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode2/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf), DeepMind described AlphaCode2 as a significant improvement over the first AlphaCode and said it performed better than 85% of competition participants on Codeforces.\n\n>When evaluated on the Codeforces platform \u2013 a mainstay of competitive programming \u2013 AlphaCode 2 solves 43% of problems within 10 attempts, close to twice as many problems as the original AlphaCode (25%). While its predecessor performed at the level of the median competitor, we estimate that AlphaCode 2 reaches the 85th percentile on average.\n\nSo far AlphaCode results appear to be based on a comparison of its performance to those of contestants without actually entering the contest. [Discussions of the results](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123035) by Codeforces users correctly guessed that a user known as AdamentChicken2 was one of the accounts used to submit AlphaCode 2 solutions, which was [confirmed by the user](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123035?#comment-1091379) and in an X (formerly Twitter) posts ([1](https://twitter.com/RemiLeblond/status/1732712334626361671), [2](https://twitter.com/RemiLeblond/status/1732677521290789235)) by DeepMind research scientist R\u00e9mi Leblond.",

    "background_text": "In 2020, Republicans gained seats in the House of Representatives despite losing the White House, leaving the Democrats with the thinnest margin in decades. Historically, there is often a backlash against the winner of the presidential election during the first term, so majority control could flip. However, redistricting following the 2020 Census will have its effect too.\n\nIf Republicans win 218* seats or more in 2024, they will secure a majority in the house. Will that happen?\n\n435* seats will be contested in 2024 (most in November, but some runoffs are possible). The question resolves after enough races have been called by reliable media reports to give a majority to one party or another. In case of ongoing ambiguity, the question can resolve when the Congress convenes in January 2025 and certifies its membership.",

    "question": "Before Jan 1, 2025, will Ontario Premier Doug Ford call an early provincial election scheduled for 2025?",
    "background_text": "Premier Doug Ford from the Canadian Province of Ontario has ruled out the possibility of an election in 2024 but has not definitively ruled out calling an early election in 2025. While the province\u2019s next fixed election date is scheduled for June 2026, Ford has stated that preparations for potential elections are underway, including setting a December 2024 deadline for his party's members of provincial parliament to decide whether they will run again. Ford emphasized the importance of readiness and has encouraged year-round door-knocking efforts by Progressive Conservative caucus members.\n\nThe political climate in Ontario has been charged with speculation about an early election. Opposition parties have ramped up campaign preparations. The Ontario New Democrats raised $1.1 million over the summer of 2024, citing strong grassroots support. The Ontario Liberals, under new leader Bonnie Crombie, have raised nearly $3 million since December 2023 and have started organizing campaign staff and volunteers. Both parties have linked Ford's potential motivation for an early election to controversies such as the RCMP investigation into the Greenbelt land swap, which initially removed protected land for development but was reversed after public backlash.\n\nIn response to election speculation, Ford has shifted focus to key policy issues, including job creation, healthcare, education, and infrastructure projects. However, opposition parties argue that Ford may use an early election to circumvent growing criticism and investigations.  \n\nThis political backdrop raises questions about whether Doug Ford will leverage his majority government status to call an election in 2025.\n\nSource: [The Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/ford-rules-out-ontario-election-in-2024-but-could-call-an-early-election-in-2025/article_12533cae-3492-55f5-90ee-fb0cad937426.html)",

Among the replication attempts are claims that LK-99 is a superconductor at [110K Tc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01192).\n\nIf it is, that would be a new family of unusually high temperature ambient pressure superconductors. So far, all the high temperature ambient pressure superconductors are based on cuprates or iron.\n\nEarly superconductors were all found at very low temperatures, and discoveries above 20K were not made until the 1970s. [High-temperature superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity) are usually defined as those with Tc above 77K, but even superconductors exceeding 30K are fairly unusual materials.\n\nOther superconductor families include metals and metal alloys, nickelates, carbon compounds (fullerenes, nanotubes, diamond, and doped relatives), and some high-pressure families. None of the ceramics and oxides include lead or phosphorous as major constituents.\n\nThe propose LK-99 structure is CuO25P6Pb9. It is almost entirely lead, oxygen, and phosphorus.\n\nOne of the many questions surround LK-99 is whether the described composition is correct, and in particular whether trace impurities are important. Variant recipes have been suggested, along with questions about replacing the copper with other elements.\n\nRather than asking whether LK-99 as described superconducts at room temperature, this question asks the much broader question of whether any related material superconducts at a much broader temperature range.",

This situation culminated in the second Libyan civil war.\n\nIn the past nine years since 2014, Libya has been ruled by multiple rival governments in control over various parts of the country. Multiple attempts have been made to unify these governments, of which many have broken down one way or another. \n\nCurrently, Libya is ruled by the transitional Government of National Unity, supported by the House of Representatives. (Although some sources claim the Government of National Unity is opposed by parts of the House of Representatives and several other smaller political organisations.) The Government of National Unity has a president as head of state and in command of the armed forces. This position is currently held by al-Menfi, who was appointed as part of the ongoing peace process.\n\nA free election for the Presidential position has been planned and postponed repeatedly, mainly over conflict about the process and rules for running. The most recent postponement at the end of 2022 did not come with the announcement of a new timeframe. With the last postponement, the electoral democracy index of Libya has taken another dive.

    "question": "Will China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 19.0 for November 2024?",
    "background_text": "China's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.",
