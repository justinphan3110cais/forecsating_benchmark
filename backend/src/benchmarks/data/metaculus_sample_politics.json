Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft.

According to [Indonesian election law](https://rumahpemilu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UU-No.7-Tahun-2017-tentang-Pemilu.pdf), all candidates must register with the General Election Commission (KPU); the period for doing so ended on 14 December, 2023, eliminating the possibility of any other candidates competing.\n\nIndonesian presidential elections are direct, and determined by the popular vote. The law states that if no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, then a second round of voting will be held from which all but the two most successful candidates in the first round are to be eliminated. This was the case in 2004 and 2009, after which only two candidates have run (Prabowo and Joko Widodo, the latter of whom won in both 2014 and 2019 but is limited to two terms as President) until now. The first round in 2024 will be held on 14 February, and any second round is to be held on 26 June.",

    "background_text": "On March 7, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously advanced two pieces legislation both on a 50-0 vote - the [\"Protecting Americans\u2019 Data from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024\"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7520?s=1&r=1) (H.R. 7520) and the [\"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521?s=1&r=1) (H.R. 7521). These two bills, if passed and sign into law, would prevent applications from being available in US app stores or web hosting services when those applications are subject to the control of a foreign adversary, as defined by Congress in Title 10. This would include TikTok, currently owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company.\n\nThe bills also create a process for apps to remain on US app stores and web hosting services if they sever ties to entities subject to the control of a foreign adversary through divestment.  This suggests that these laws, if passed, would require ByteDance to sell off TikTok or face it being banned in the United States.",

The delayed vote has led to [protests and unrest](https://news.yahoo.com/ahead-planned-march-over-vote-122105603.html), as well as a state crackdown against the protests.\n\nSall's term is scheduled to end on April 2, 2024, and the delayed elections have [led to uncertainty regarding whether Sall will respect the term limit](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68253255).\n\nSenegal is in the geographical region of Africa that has seen a high rate of coups the past three years. Despite this, Senegal had previously maintained some stability and helped coordinate responses against coups elsewhere in the region.\n\nYet when Sall was [interviewed by *The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/26/senegals-president-asks-if-democracy-can-work-in-africas-coup-belt) in October 2023 he asked,\n\n> \"Is democracy as we want to do it really suitable?\"\n\nPreviously there had been a damaging fight between the incumbent president and an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko. The Economist wrote,\n\n> The fight centres around the question of whether Senegal\u2019s government is trying to tilt the election by using the courts to keep Mr Sonko off the ballot.\n\nThis has involved accusations of rape (acquitted), corruption of youth (convicted), plotting an insurrection (still active). The opposition claims this is repeating a pattern from 2019 when the opposition was also barred from running due to criminal convictions. The incumbent president denies this.\n\n> The charge and conviction sparked large protests, some of them violent, in support of Mr Sonko. The demonstrations were also fuelled by hints from Mr Sall that he might try to run for a third presidential term, even though Senegal\u2019s constitution has a two-term limit. It was only in July that Mr Sall definitively said he would not seek office again, after more than two years of protests and at least 37 deaths, according to Amnesty International, a rights group.\n\n> Mr Sall\u2019s announcement led to a lull in the violence, though it lasted less than a month until Mr Sonko was once more arrested. The government also dissolved his political party, Pastef, and arrested many of its leaders, including several mayors. As protests flared, the government cut mobile-internet access for almost a week.\n\nThere seems to be insecurities around how peaceful Senegal's democracy really is:\n\n> Many fear more violence before the election, especially if Mr Sonko is definitively barred from running. Even Mr Sall prevaricates when asked if he expects the election to be peaceful. [...] Mr Sall bristles at the suggestion there has been a backsliding of democracy on his watch. \u201cThose who say that [there has been] are supporters of anarchy and chaos,\u201d he retorts. \u201cSenegal has no lessons in democracy to learn from anyone.\u201d",

Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft.

Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

These expansion plans, like prior ones, have seen widespread condemnation from both pro and anti-Israeli nations. This condemnation is primarily based on the alarming number of deaths and casualties stemming from the ground invasion; the growing humanitarian crisis, which has become more acute as the Israeli invasion has expanded; and the vast number of Palestinian refugees which are reportedly taking refuge in the city having fled from Northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael has already [commenced airstrikes and covert raids in Rafah](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-12/israel-conducts-strikes-in-rafah-as-humanitarian-concerns-mount), but a full-scale ground invasion has yet to commence.\n\nAmongst the nations who have condemned the plans are the US - Israel's closest ally - and Egypt - Gaza's Southern neighbour who has threatened to break it's 45 year old peace treaty with Israel if the ground invasion plans commence in Rafah.\n\nWill Israel expand its ground offensive to Rafah by the first day of Ramadan?",

Unlike in the US, the speaker of the House of Commons in the UK is not a member of either party and is conventionally strictly non-partisan. \n\nOn the 21st of February 2024, he caused tremendous controversy and uproar amongst members of the Tory and SNP parties when, on the SNP's opposition day (a day where the SNP decides which issues are debated in the House of Commons) he selected the Labour amendment to the SNP's motion to be debated, in addition to the SNPs motion. This was controversial because the Tory government had also put forth an amendment for consideration, and long-standing precedent is that if the government puts forward an amendment, then only that amendment will be considered in addition to the original motion. \n\nMembers of the SNP expressed their fury with the decision, as it undermined their opposition day and as it posed the possibility of the house not being able to vote on the SNPs own motion on its opposition day. The Tory Party was upset because in addition to breaking with convention, the decision put many members of the government in a politically precarious position because it would likely result in the government's own amendment not being considered. As a result, the Tory Party abstained from both votes, and the SNP's motion and the Labour amendments passed unanimously without a division. \n\nIn statements in the House after the motion and amendment had passed, the leader of the SNP and Tory parties both expressed their concern over their parties to have confidence in the speaker's impartiality going forward.",

Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft. The company already has [a perpetual license to all OpenAI IP](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51) ([short of artificial general intelligence](https://openai.com/our-structure#:~:text=the%20board%20determines%20when%20we%27ve%20attained%20AGI.%20Again%2C%20by%20AGI%20we%20mean%20a%20highly%20autonomous%20system%20that%20outperforms%20humans%20at%20most%20economically%20valuable%20work.%20Such%20a%20system%20is%20excluded%20from%20IP%20licenses%20and%20other%20commercial%20terms%20with%20Microsoft%2C%20which%20only%20apply%20to%20pre%2DAGI%20technology.)), including source code and model weights; the question was whether it would have the talent to exploit that IP if OpenAI suffered the sort of talent drain that was threatened upon Altman and Brockman\u2019s removal. Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

However, recent polling suggests that Farage is favoured to win the constituency. \n\nThe Times: [Nigel Farage set to win Clacton \u2018with biggest swing in modern history\u2019](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/farage-set-to-win-clacton-with-biggest-swing-in-modern-history-5tzjsmtw6)\n\n>Nigel Farage is on course to win the Clacton seat with the biggest swing in modern electoral history, a new poll has suggested.\n\n>The survey, commissioned by Arron Banks, a former Ukip donor, suggests that Farage will win 42 per cent of the vote in Clacton in Essex. The Tories are forecast to win 27 per cent and Labour 24 per cent.\n\n>Survation, the company that carried out the survey, said the scale of the projected swing from the Tories to Reform would be \u201cextremely rare\u201d and \u201cunprecedented in modern electoral history\u201d.",

Since then, the Conservatives have maintained control of Parliament.

In spite of this apparent weakness, Labour has also lacked a key leader, and the rise of the Scottish National Party, which shares appeal with Labour (their founder was Scottish), has led to a loss of most seats from Labour to the SNP.  Some Scottish constituencies have experienced vote-splitting between Labour and the SNP, allowing Conservatives to gain seats there.\n\nCurrently, British law requires that the next general election be held [no later than January 28, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election).",

The situation deteriorated significantly following a major terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, described as the largest terrorist attack in Israel's history. This attack led to over [1,400 fatalities and numerous hostages](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/05/1210641727/israel-war-hamas-latest-updates), prompting a severe military response from Israel. In retaliation, the Israeli military launched an extensive offensive involving air, sea, and ground operations against Gaza. This has included a total siege aimed at curtailing the capabilities of Hamas, the ruling authority in the Gaza Strip. The conflict has resulted in a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, exacerbating the long-standing difficulties faced by the civilian population in the area.\nIn [previous wars](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/arab-israeli-war) Israel engaged in warfare with up to five Arab nations. At the moment, however, it is unclear and unlikely that neighbouring Arab countries will join the fighting, having already shown [unwillingness to take refugees](https://apnews.com/article/palestinian-jordan-egypt-israel-refugee-502c06d004767d4b64848d878b66bd3d).",

    "question": "Will the US government end its agreement directly allowing Verisign to manage the authoritative domain name registry for the .com TLD before August 3, 2024?",
    "background_text": "[Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) operates the authoritative registry for the .com generic top-level domain (TLD) under a registry agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and a [Cooperative Agreement](https://www.ntia.gov/page/verisign-cooperative-agreement) with the US Department of Commerce (DOC). This means it is the wholesale provider of the .com TLD to every domain name registrar. The American Economic Liberties Projected [has called](https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/ntia-and-doj-must-break-verisigns-monopoly-power-over-domain-names-advocates-urge/) this arrangement a \"government-designated monopoly over domain registration.\" According to [The American Prospect](https://prospect.org/power/2024-06-27-government-created-most-profitable-company-verisign/):\n\n>You have probably never heard of the most profitable company in America, and possibly the world. It\u2019s a government-granted monopoly that feasts on high margins for a low-dollar administrative product. Today, three advocacy groups pressured the Biden administration to take down the rules in place that enable this gravy train.\n\n>The company is called VeriSign [*sic*], and it has exclusive control of the registration system for the .com domain name. Every year, hundreds of millions of website owners pay VeriSign [*sic*] a small annual fee to keep their .com in working order. Every year, the cost of managing the database to make sure that .com websites work either stays flat or goes down, while the fee for registering a .com website goes up.\n\nThe Cooperative Agreement between Verisign and the US DOC will automatically renew for a six-year term unless the DOC provides notice of non-renewal on August 2, 2024.\n\nAccording to [Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/IXZ3V#selection-1705.0-1726.0), during the 2018 renewal the Trump Administration lifted the cap on wholesale prices for *.com*. The antitrust advocacy groups have written to the Justice Department to withdraw guidance that allowed the elimination of price caps in the 2018 renewal, with the letters citing President Biden\u2019s 2021 [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/) on competition.",
