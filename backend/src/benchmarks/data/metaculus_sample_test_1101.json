    "background_text": "Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, has been involved in an array of legal battles post his presidency. Currently facing three indictments with the prospect of a fourth, his legal circumstances have sparked curiosity about the possible outcomes.\n\n**Assessing the Odds**\n\nEstimating the odds of a jury reaching a guilty verdict in at least one of Trump's cases can be complex. Historically, federal conviction rates in the U.S have been relatively high, often surpassing 90%. However, this figure doesn't necessarily imply the same odds for Trump's case. The likelihood of a guilty verdict depends heavily on the evidence, the nature of the crimes, the lawyers involved, the jury's composition, and public opinion, among other factors.\n\n**The \"Stealth Juror\" Scenario**\n\nOne of the factors complicating the trial outcome is the possibility of a 'stealth juror'. In this context, a stealth juror refers to a passionate Trump supporter (who didn't vote in 2016 and 2020 for whatever reasons) pretending to be neutral who, despite being obliged to judge impartially, could be biased in their judgement. If at least one juror refuses to agree with the others, it could lead to a hung jury, which may complicate the process further.\n\nU.S courts use a process called voir dire to select impartial jurors. While this process is usually effective, it is not foolproof. A passionate supporter could potentially hide their bias, impacting the verdict. However, such a scenario is relatively rare and challenging to pull off. Furthermore, even if a stealth juror manages to cause a hung jury in one case, the likelihood of this happening consistently across multiple trials is low.\n\nBesides backing Trump, a juror could have other motivations for opposing a guilty verdict in a federal trial against a former president.",

Antimony, used in bullets, nuclear weapons production, and lead-acid batteries, is just one of many metals that China has a significant share of global production.\n\nThe announcement follows China's previous export controls [on graphite](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-use-graphite-export-restrictions-encourages-diversification) in 2023 and restrictions on germanium and gallium, two metals used in chipmaking, in response to U.S. efforts to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. These moves have led some industry experts to speculate that China may soon impose export controls on other critical metals, such as tungsten, which is nearly as hard as a diamond and used in weapons, semiconductors, and industrial cutting machines.\n\nChina's actions are seen by some as retaliatory measures against what it perceives as intrusions into its national interests. As a result, companies in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring alternatives to reduce their reliance on China for critical metals. However, it remains to be seen whether China will follow through with a blanket implementation of the latest export controls or announce restrictions on additional metals in the near future.",

Amazing details on Blaine\u2019s feat are available in this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_blaine_how_i_held_my_breath_for_17_min) \n\nAll very nice. But bioengineering will allow us to push the record up\u2014possibily, way up. Some techniques, like \u201clung packing,\u201d are already being put to use by daredevils. [Per Deadspin](https://deadspin.com/how-long-can-humans-hold-their-breath-1467541916): \n\n> This [lung packing] consists of inhaling the very largest breath possible, and then, without exhaling, puffing your cheeks full of more air and attempting to force that air down into your lungs. You are literally stretching out your lungs so that they can hold more air.\n\nMore exotic ideas, like the so-called [\u201cAquaman Crystal\u201d](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-create-crystal-which-could-allow-us-to-breathe-underwater-9772871.html) are promising.\n\nSome extreme atheletes and freedivers are no doubt experimenting and [pushing the limits](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/11/nicholas_mevoli_freediving_death_what_happens_to_people_who_practice_holding.html).\n\nAnd there are documented cases on the record of people surviving without oxygen for long periods of time. As the [BBC reports](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140714-how-long-can-you-go-without-air):\n\n> When US toddler Michelle Funk fell into an icy stream in 1986, she survived an estimated 66 minutes underwater, preserved by deep hypothermia that reduced her metabolic rate to almost nothing.\n\nFunk\u2019s case was a freak accident.

    "background_text": "China's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.",

    "background_text": "In its article [Q&A: Everything You Should Know About Government Shutdowns](https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-government-shutdowns) the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget describes government shutdowns as follows:\n\n>Many federal government agencies and programs rely on annual funding appropriations passed by Congress. Every year, Congress must pass, and the President must sign budget legislation for the next fiscal year, consisting of 12 appropriations bills, one for each Appropriations subcommittee. Congress has not yet enacted any of the 12 bills for FY 2023 that make up the discretionary spending budget and has instead been funding the government through a CR that was enacted at the end of September. In a \u201cshutdown,\u201d federal agencies must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. Essential services continue to function, as do mandatory spending programs.\n\n>. . .\n\n>Since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, there have been 20 \u201cfunding gaps,\u201d including the 2018-2019 shutdown and the one in January 2018, when funds were not appropriated for at least one day. (The hours-long lapse in appropriations in February 2018, though sometimes characterized as a shutdown, did not result in federal employee furloughs.) However, before 1980, the government did not shut down but rather continued normal operations through six funding gaps. Since 1981, 10 funding gaps of three days or fewer have occurred, mostly over a weekend when government operations were only minimally affected. \n>\n>There have now been four \u201ctrue\u201d shutdowns where operations were affected for more than one business day. The first two happened in the winter of 1995-1996 when President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were unable to agree on spending levels and the government shut down twice, for a total of 26 days. The third was in 2013 when a House and Senate standoff over funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) resulted in a 16-day shutdown. The fourth shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019, technically only a partial shutdown because five of the 12 appropriations had previously been enacted, centered on a dispute over border wall funding and was the longest-lasting shutdown at 35 days.\n\nThe History, Art & Archives of the US House of Representatives [provides a list](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Shutdown/Government-Shutdowns/) of funding gaps and whether or not they included shutdowns. The US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) maintains [information about shutdown furloughs](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/#Shutdown-Furlough) as well as [shutdown contingency plans for agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/agency-contingency-plans/).",

    "background_text": "According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON546):\n\n> Between 24 October and 5 December 2024, Panzi health zone in Kwango Province of Democratic Republic of the Congo recorded 406 cases of an undiagnosed disease with symptoms of fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body ache. All severe cases were reported to be severely malnourished. Among the cases, 31 deaths have been registered. The majority of cases reported are among children, particularly those under five years of age. The area is rural and remote, with access further hindered by the ongoing rainy season. Reaching it from Kinshasa by road takes an estimated 48 hours. These challenges, coupled with limited diagnostics in the region, have delayed the identification of the underlying cause. Rapid response teams have been deployed to identify the cause of the outbreak and strengthen the response. The teams are collecting samples for laboratory testing, providing a more detailed clinical characterization of the detected cases, investigating the transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level. The teams are also aiding with the treatment of patients, risk communication and community engagement. Given the clinical presentation and symptoms reported, and a number of associated deaths, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as potential causal factors with malnutrition as a contributing factor. Malaria is a common disease in this area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases. Laboratory tests are underway to determine the exact cause. At this stage, it is also possible that more than one disease is contributing to the cases and deaths.",

Examples include lethal effect to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, reactor core melt.\" The prime example of a \"major nuclear accident\" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\n\nThe situation regarding Russian control of Ukrainian nuclear reactors, particularly the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), has been a [focal point of concern](https://www.world-nuclear.org/ukraine-information/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy.aspx) since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The ZNPP, Europe's largest nuclear plant with six reactors, has been under Russian occupation since the early stages of the invasion in February 2022. The plant came under armed attack in March 2022, marking the first instance of an operating civil nuclear power plant being attacked during an active conflict. This attack led to a projectile hitting a training building and resulted in a fire, but essential equipment and the reactors remained unaffected\u200b\u200b.\n\nSince the conflict began, the [operation of the reactors has varied](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197574725/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-power-plants), with some being taken offline or put online as needed, depending on the stability of external power supplies and conditions around the plants\u200b\u200b.\n\n> There are six reactors at Zaporizhzhia maintained by Energoatom personnel, according to Kotin, but Russia controls the plant. Those reactors are currently offline. Meanwhile, Ukraine is operating nine reactors generating electricity at three other locations around the country.\n\nIn June 2023, Russia and Ukraine accused each other of [plotting to stage an attack on ZNPP](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-accuse-each-other-plotting-imminent-attack-nuclear-station-2023-07-04/).",

While their orbits and properties vary, ranging from double our Moon\u2019s mass to thirty times Jupiter\u2019s, their atmospheres\u2019 compositions are harder to detect.\n\nAs of this writing this means we have mostly data from exoplanets we detected by transition and occlusion methods, but also other kind of exoplanets. However we only found *what* is in their air, not *how much* or its ratio in the atmosphere. What we did detect of their atmospheres was often hydrogen, sodium, water vapour, carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, and even oxygen, depending on the respective exoplanet.\n\nSadly, the presence of O2 isn\u2019t the smoking gun for extraterrestrial life some media like to report it for. There are atmospheric and geological processes that produce detectable\u2014[or even massive](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2014.1231)\u2014amounts of oxygen, keeping the mere presence of O2 from being a robust biomarker. On the flip side, too much oxygen is also possible, and may prevent or hamper the development of life. \n\nSo far we lack a method that would determine the composition percentages of exoplanet atmospheres, but that doesn\u2019t mean someone clever won\u2019t come up with a way.

    "background_text": "In late February and March 2014, following the Euromaidan uprising and removal of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, thinly disguised Russian military and paramilitary forces seized control of the Crimean peninsula in the far South of Ukraine and of most of the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in its East, leading to a protracted conflict.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale conventional invasion of Ukraine. One of its first objectives was to seize the band of territory in Ukraine's southeast, between the Azov Sea and the Dnipro river, which connects Crimea in the south and Donetsk and Luhansk in the East.\n\nThrough the Spring and Summer of 2022, Ukraine achieved a series of counteroffensive victories and expelled Russian forces from a large area of the country. In September, Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), in his [programmatic article](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3566162-ak-zabezpeciti-voennu-kampaniu-u-2023-roci-ukrainskij-poglad.html) on Ukraine\u2019s coming campaign of 2023, called Crimea the \"*center of gravity of the enemy*\" and advised planning operations to seize it. Removing the Russian protective belt around the peninsula would be the first step towards achieving this goal. If executed simultaneously with destroying the Crimean bridge near Kerch it would cut off Crimea from supplies by land. Already in August, Arestovych, an advisor to president Zelensky, had [floated the idea]( https://www.unian.net/war/arestovich-schitaet-uspeh-v-melitopole-strategicheski-vazhnym-dlya-vsu-novosti-vtorzheniya-rossii-na-ukrainu-11935857.html) of an offensive on Melitopol, a key transportation hub on the land bridge, and opined that its success would collapse the entire Russian frontline. \n\nIn November 2022, with their supply lines in serious danger from Ukrainian artillery, the Russian occupiers fled Kherson for the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro, leaving the southeastern land bridge as the obvious next objective. Several Russian military bloggers predicted a land bridge offensive, with variations in timing, possible tactics and the exact direction of attack, e.g. [Dimitriev](https://t.me/russ_orientalist/12458), [MIG]( https://t.me/mig41/22148), [Moscow Calling]( https://t.me/m0sc0wcalling/14259), [Nesmiyan]( https://t.me/RSaponkov/3947) and [Saponkov]( https://t.me/RSaponkov/3947).\n\nOn the Ukrainian side, the [New York Times cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/world/europe/ukraine-war-strategy-russia.html) \"*hints from the troops on the ground and volunteers close to them*\" that preparations for such an offensive were in the works. Russian forces were said to be aware of the danger and [to have been reinforcing their units and fortifying their lines]( https://ria.ru/20221019/svo-1825016250.html) in the Southeast for some time.\n\nThere is some flexibility with the direction of the offensive. Ukraine can strike in the east, towards Mariupol, in the center, towards Berdyansk or Melitopol (the most discussed option), or even in the west, from the newly captured Kherson towards Henichesk. Cutting the land bridge in two could be a first step to reoccupying it entirely, leaving Russia with no more territory than it started with, and potentially bringing the war closer to its termination.\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive [began in June 2022](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/06/08/russia-ukraine-war-news-counteroffensive/), but as of December 2023, it does not appear close to severing the land bridge, and in fact there are [significant doubts about its chances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/ukraine-counteroffensive-us-planning-russia-war/) [of](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/us/politics/us-ukraine-war-strategy.html)  [success](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war-drones-stalemate/).

As an [offshoot](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kp2-now-dominant-covid-variant-experts-us-summer/story?id=110166187) of the [omicron variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant), KP (specifically KP.2 at the time) [first reached](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a1.htm) >10% prevalence in April 2024. KP.3.1.1 [became](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/kp-3-1-1-is-the-predominant-variant.html) the predominant variant in August 2024. \n\nRecently another new COVID variant has been rapidly [growing](https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2024/10/22/what-is-covid-19-variant-xec-spreading-in-pennsylvania/75794702007/) in the United States, the XEC variant, which is estimated at 17% according to the October 26th Nowcast. This is a sharp increase from the two-week period ended September 14, 2024, when it was 2%. Even at 17% following its rapid gains, XEC is still a distant second to KP.3.1.1, which is 57% according to the Nowcast. However, results from [one recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618773v1) \"suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1.\"\n\nAt the time of this question, CDC estimates variant proportions using two-week periods, using two different calculations: weighted estimates and Nowcast estimates. According [to CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions):\n\n>Weighted estimates (provided for all two-week periods except the most recent two, two-week periods) are variant proportions that are based on empirical (observed) genomic sequencing data. These estimates are not available for the most recent two-week periods because of the time it takes to generate the sequencing data, including sample collection, specimen treatment, shipping, analysis, and upload into public databases.\n\n>Lineages with weighted estimates less than 1% of all circulating variants are combined with their parent lineage. When the weighted estimate of a lineage crosses the 1% threshold and has substitutions in the spike protein that could affect vaccine efficacy, transmission, or severity, it may be separated from its parent lineage and displayed on its own in the variant proportions data.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n>Nowcast estimates (provided for the most recent two two-week periods when the \"Nowcast on\" option is selected below) are model-based projections of variant proportions for the most recent two-week periods to enable timely public health action. CDC uses the Nowcast to forecast variant proportions before the weighted estimates are available for a given two-week period.\n\nDue to the greater reliability,  verifiability, and empirical basis of the Weighted estimate, this question resolves based on that figure.",

Most states elect their representatives by the plurality method, where voters cast a vote for one candidate and the one with the highest number of votes wins.\n\nThe U.S. has a strong two-party system, with the Republicans (GOP) and Democrats taking center stage in the country's political life and other parties having little influence.\n\nOf the past 10 House elections, in 3 of them the party winning the popular vote across all districts did not win the majority of House seats:\n\n| Election | Popular vote won by GOP | Seats won by GOP (out of 435) |\n|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2022     | 50.6%                   | 222                    |\n| 2020     | 47.2%                   | 213                    |\n| 2018     | 44.8%                   | 199                    |\n| 2016     | 49.1%*                   | 241*                    |\n| 2014     | 51.2%                   | 247                    |\n| 2012     | 47.7%*                   | 234*                    |\n| 2010     | 51.7%                   | 242                    |\n| 2008     | 42.6%                   | 178                    |\n| 2006     | 44.3%                   | 202                    |\n| 2004     | 49.4%*                   | 232*                    |\n\n*Election in which the popular vote winner did not achieve a House majority.",
