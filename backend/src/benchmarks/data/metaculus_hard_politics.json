      "### Step 1: Core Factual Points\n<facts>\n1. On April 1, 2024, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, resulting in significant casualties, including the deaths of top Iranian commanders.\n2. The United States has increased its security posture in the region, anticipating a retaliatory strike by Iran against Israeli or American assets.\n3. Senior U.S. and Israeli officials consider such an attack \"inevitable.\"\n4. On April 13, 2024, Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for the April 1 airstrike. Most projectiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defense, with minimal damage reported.\n5. Iran declared the matter \"concluded\" after the April 13 attack, but Israel typically does not accept such resolutions.\n6. U.S. officials anticipate that Israel's response to Iran's recent drone and missile strikes will be limited, likely targeting Iranian military forces and proxies outside Iran.\n7. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned that any Israeli attack would provoke a stronger response from Tehran.\n8. The U.S. has deployed additional troops and equipment to the Middle East to enhance regional deterrence and protect U.S. forces.\n9. The situation has escalated tensions, with U.S. and allied leaders urging restraint.\n10. Israel is on high alert for a potential Iranian attack following the April 1 airstrike.\n</facts>\n\n### Step 2: Reasons Why the Answer Might Be No\n<no>\n1. **Iran's Declaration of Conclusion**: Iran has declared the matter \"concluded\" after the April 13 attack, which might indicate a temporary de-escalation. (Strength: 7)\n2. **U.S. and Allied Restraint Efforts**: U.S. and allied leaders are urging restraint, which could influence both Iran and Israel to avoid further escalation. (Strength: 6)\n3. **Effective Israeli Defense Systems**: Israel's air defense systems successfully intercepted most of the projectiles in the recent attack, which might deter Iran from attempting another attack. (Strength: 5)\n4. **Economic and Political Costs for Iran**: Further attacks could exacerbate Iran's already dire economic situation and lead to increased international isolation. (Strength: 6)\n</no>\n\n### Step 3: Reasons Why the Answer Might Be Yes\n<yes>\n1. **High Tensions and Hostility**: The relationship between Iran and Israel is highly hostile, and recent events have significantly escalated tensions. (Strength: 8)\n2. **Iran's Vow of Retaliation**: Iranian leaders, including the Supreme Leader, have vowed to punish Israel for the April 1 airstrike, indicating a high likelihood of further attacks. (Strength: 9)\n3. **Historical Precedent**: Iran has a history of supporting proxy militias and conducting retaliatory attacks against Israeli targets. (Strength: 7)\n4. **Potential Israeli Provocations**: Any Israeli response to the recent Iranian attack could provoke further retaliation from Iran. (Strength: 8)\n</yes>\n\n### Step 4: Aggregated Considerations\n<thinking>\nThe situation is highly volatile, with significant recent escalations and a history of hostility between Iran and Israel. While Iran has declared the matter \"concluded\" after the April 13 attack, this does not preclude further actions, especially if provoked by Israeli responses. The U.S. and allied efforts to urge restraint and the effectiveness of Israeli defense systems might mitigate the likelihood of another attack, but the high tensions and Iran's vows of retaliation weigh heavily towards the possibility of further conflict.\n\nGiven the recent direct confrontation and the statements from Iranian leaders, the probability of another deadly attack by Iran before May 1, 2024, is non-negligible. However, the declaration of conclusion and international efforts for restraint provide some counterbalance.\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 5: Initial Probability\n<tentative>\n0.65\n</tentative>\n\n### Step 6: Reflection and Sanity Checks\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of such events and the specific context. Historically, direct state-on-state attacks between Iran and Israel are rare, with most conflicts occurring through proxy forces. The recent direct confrontation is an outlier, suggesting a higher probability than usual but not an overwhelming certainty.\n\nThe declaration of conclusion by Iran and the international calls for restraint should not be underestimated. These factors, combined with the effectiveness of Israeli defenses, suggest that while the probability of another attack is elevated, it should not be overly high.\n\nAdjusting for these considerations, a more calibrated probability would be slightly lower than the initial estimate.\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 7: Final Prediction\n<answer>\n*0.55*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "ISTANBUL \u2014 Israel is on high alert for a possible attack from Iran, following an airstrike that hit the Iranian consulate in Syria two weeks ago and killed several senior Iranian military officers. Iran blames Israel for the attack, and has vowed to retaliate. Many countries have issued warnings to their citizens not to visit the region, as tensions flare and fears grow that an Iranian attack may be imminent \u2014 and the war in Gaza may spread. Iranian leaders have been among the sharpest critics of Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip. Tehran has made no secret of its praise for those who attack Israelis, including the Hamas-led attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people on Oct. 7. Israel compiled a video showing Hamas gunmen killing civilians, including babies, and burning corpses. Human Rights Watch verified some of the videos of the attack, and called on the International Criminal Court to investigate the attacks as war crimes. Iran, however, wasted no time in hailing the Hamas attack as a \"victory.\" Hours after news of the attack broke on Oct. 7, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani told Iran's ISNA news agency that \"What took place today is in line with the continuation of victories of the anti-Zionist resistance in different fields, including Syria, Lebanon and occupied lands.\" Iran blames Israel for the April 1 airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus that killed seven members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two IRGC generals. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the attack. If Israel was responsible, it would be the latest in a long line of attacks against Iranian targets. 1979 was a pivotal year While Iran was ruled by the Pahlavi dynasty for more than a half-century, Iranian-Israeli bilateral relations were far from hostile. Iran was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize the new state of Israel. Palestinians saw that recognition as a tacit international acceptance of what they call the \"Nakba,\" or catastrophe \u2014 the forced dispossession and displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948. For its part, Israel was quick to establish ties with non-Arab states, including military and security cooperation with Iran. Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, though, sent relations between the two nations into a tailspin. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted, and the new supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, pursued a policy of standing up to \"arrogant\" world powers. During his regime, the United States became known in Iran as the \"Great Satan,\" and Israel as the \"Little Satan.\" Even so, limited cooperation between Israel and Iran continued into the 1980s. But later a hostile rivalry emerged as Iran built up and funded proxy militias and other groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. A shadow war between Iran and Israel grew over the years. Iran's nuclear program is a main target Iran's nuclear program \u2014 which it has always insisted is entirely peaceful \u2014 has been a primary focus of Israeli attacks. Tehran believes Israel and the U.S. introduced the Stuxnet computer virus in the early 2000s to target the centrifuges enriching uranium for Iran's nuclear program A series of sabotage attacks continued into the 2020s, as Israel sought to damage Iranian nuclear facilities. Nuclear scientists were also targeted. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 was seen as a blow to Tehran and a victory for Israel. Iran continues to insist that its program is 100% peaceful, although certain incidents, such as an unexplained discovery of uranium particles at sites Iran never disclosed to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, trouble critics who doubt Iran's motives. With Iran firmly under the control of Islamist hard-liners, and conservatives leading Israel, there seems little likelihood of a return to cordial Iranian-Israeli relations anytime soon. War by proxy Iran has long backed armed groups around the region that target Israel as well as the U.S. military. The main one is Hezbollah in Lebanon, formed in the 1980s to fight the Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has been firing rockets into northern Israel since the Gaza war began in October. Iran also supports Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that led the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the current war, which Gaza health authorities say has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, over the past six months. Iran also has provided support to Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have fired ballistic missiles at the Israeli resort town Eilat on the Red Sea, and attacked shipping vessels \u2014 attacks which the Houthi rebels say are in support of Hamas. Iran supports the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad, and Israel says Tehran uses Syrian territory to ship missiles and other weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has carried out numerous airstrikes in Syria to halt that flow of weapons, and said the Iranian general killed in the consulate strike was a key figure in that logistical chain. Now, however, American and Israeli officials are warning of the risk of a direct attack by Iran against Israel. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said the April 1 attack on the consulate building in Damascus, for which Iran blames Israel, was tantamount to an attack on Iranian territory. He has threatened that Israel \"must be punished and shall be.\" Israel has said that an attack from Iranian soil would be met with a direct response against Iran. That could trigger a major regional war. U.S. officials say that they have sent messages to allies with closer ties to Tehran to urge Iran to exercise restraint. The U.S. officials noted that the U.S. has also relayed the same message directly to Iranian officials.",

          "raw_content": "The Pentagon said Tuesday that Israel was behind the airstrike in Damascus, Syria, that killed seven people, including a top Iranian commander, even though Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary, told reporters Tuesday that Israel was behind the airstrike in Damascus has led Iran to say it would retaliate. \"The U.S. did not conduct a strike in Damascus,\" said Singh. \"I would refer you to the Israelis to speak to their strike.\" Singh later said that the U.S. assessed that Israel was behind the airstrike and that several leaders from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had been killed in the airstrike. \"Our initial assessment right now is that it was a few top IRGC leaders, we haven't been able to independently confirm identities, but that is our initial assessment right now,\" she said. Singh added that \"we were not notified by the Israelis about their strike or the intended target of their strike in Damascus.\" The building that was struck in Damascus has been described as Iran's consulate in Syria and was located near the diplomatic facilities of other countries in Syria. \"I don't have a lot of details on what type of building that was, but no, we don't support attacks on diplomatic facilities,\" she added. Israel has not confirmed that it was behind the attack nor has it denied that it was responsible for the strike that Iran said killed Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, his deputy Gen. Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi, and five other IRGC officers. That is typical for Israel which is believed to have launched dozens if not hundreds of airstrikes inside Syria in recent years. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed revenge on Israel on Tuesday for the airstrike. \"The evil regime (will be punished by the hands of our brave men,\" said Khameini in a statement posted on his official website. \"We will make them regret this crime and similar ones, God willing.\" Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has also said that \"the United States should be answerable\" for the attack. \"Let me make it clear, we had nothing to do with the strike in Damascus,\" John Kirby, the White House National Security Communications Advisor told reporters at the White House. \"So, the comments by the Iranian foreign minister that somehow we're to blame is just nonsense. We had nothing to do with it.\" Singh noted that the United States had contacted Iran to tell them \"We were not responsible for this airstrike.\" She explained the United States had reached out to Iran to prevent a miscalculation given the tensions in the region. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have targeted U.S. facilities in both of those countries after Israel invaded Gaza following Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack in Israel. The last of those attacks occurred on Feb. 4, although a drone was shot down near the U.S. base at At Tanf Garrison on Monday. The base does not appear to have been targeted. \"I think that tensions being high in the region, we wanted to make it very clear in in private channels that the US had no involvement in the strike in Damascus,\" she said. \"And we did that.\"",

A defense official said the deployments are designed to \u201cbolster regional deterrence efforts and increase force protection for U.S. forces.\u201d The department did not release any information on the number of troops involved or the assets being directed to the area. Earlier in the day, White House national security spokesman John Kirby similarly declined to give specifics about U.S. military posture changes in the region but said that administration officials are monitoring the situation closely. \u201cWe have deemed the potential threat by Iran here to be real, to be viable,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now our focus is on having conversations with our Israeli counterparts to make sure that they have what they need and that they\u2019re able to defend themselves.\u201d Kirby said that work includes making sure U.S. troops in the region are \u201cproperly prepared\u201d if an attack occurs. The U.S. has about 40,000 military personnel deployed throughout the Middle East right now. About 1,000 more are headed to the area to help construct a floating pier off the coast of Gaza to help with the delivery of humanitarian aid there. In January, three U.S. soldiers were killed and 40 others injured when a drone controlled by Iran-backed militants struck their base in Jordan. The potential Iranian action comes almost two weeks after a suspected Israeli military strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus. The attack killed several Iranian military leaders in Syria as well as key Hezbollah leaders. On Friday, in response to reporters\u2019 questions about the possibility of Iranian military action, President Joe Biden said that the United States is \u201cdevoted to the defense of Israel\u201d and reiterated that \u201cwe will support Israel and help defend Israel, and Iran will not succeed.\u201d Reporter Noah Robertson contributed to this report.

The vast majority of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence system, with assistance from the ever-helpful United States military, and damage was minimal. Having completed its retaliation, Iran has now declared that the matter can \u201cbe deemed concluded\u201d \u2013 although Israel is not usually one to let anyone else have the last word.

For his part, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau whined about Iran\u2019s \u201cdisregard for peace and stability in the region\u201d, and regurgitated that old, tired slogan about \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to defend itself\u201d. Germany\u2019s Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert took to social media to proclaim German solidarity \u201cwith all Israelis tonight whom Iran is terrorising with this unprecedented and ruthless attack\u201d. Lastly, US President Joe Biden, who was forced to cut his beach weekend short due to the developments, announced: \u201cOur commitment to Israel\u2019s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad.\u201d The Iranian attack, mind you, occurred a little over six months into Israel\u2019s ongoing pulverisation of the Gaza Strip, which has killed nearly 34,000 Palestinians, including some 13,800 children. And yet given the thousands of missing persons presumed to be buried under the rubble, even these terrifying numbers are no doubt grave underestimates. More than 76,000 people have been wounded, as the Israeli military has busied itself flattening entire neighbourhoods and blowing up schools, hospitals, and other basic infrastructure, all the while condemning the territory\u2019s inhabitants to famine and starvation. Talk about \u201cterrorising\u201d. Indeed, genocide is nothing if not \u201clong term aggressive behaviour\u201d \u2013 to borrow the Czech Foreign Ministry\u2019s words. If the whole business weren\u2019t so unprecedently heinous, it would be almost laughable to claim that Iran is the one \u201cintent on sowing chaos\u201d and disregarding \u201cpeace and stability in the region\u201d. But because Israel\u2019s outsize role as a prized US partner in crime entitles it to a total subversion of logic, genocidaires become victims and unmitigated Israeli aggression becomes \u201cself-defence\u201d. And never mind the April 1 Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus; that was just preemptive retaliation, right? In light of the unceasing slaughter in Gaza, though, the Western response to the intercepted Iranian missiles and drones is sickeningly cynical. Sunak\u2019s pathetic claim that \u201cno one wants to see more bloodshed\u201d fails to account for the reality that, as long as it\u2019s Palestinian blood, it\u2019s all totally fine. Unfortunately, the Iranian spectacle may provide the Biden administration with exactly what it needs to shift the focus away from Gaza \u2013 and specifically US complicity in genocide. After all, it would be a sad day for the arms industry if the US had to stop sending so many weapons to such an active client. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the US was responsible for a full 69 percent of arms imports by the Israeli military between 2019 and 2023, when the all-out genocide kicked off. So much for \u201cpeace and stability\u201d. But one should never underestimate the imperial utility of the good old Iranian menace in justifying whatever US policy needs justifying. Recall Tehran\u2019s inclusion on the original \u201caxis of evil\u201d shortlist, courtesy of former US President George W Bush, who in his 2002 State of the Union address denounced Iran for \u201caggressively\u201d pursuing weapons of mass destruction and \u201cexport[ing] terror\u201d. Armed with said \u201caxis\u201d, the US proceeded to engage in nothing less than mass destruction and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond. Fast-forward 22 years to the present era of destruction, and the Iranian bogeyman is as handy as ever. Following this weekend\u2019s attack, perhaps everyone\u2019s favourite refrain \u201cBut do you condemn Hamas?\u201d can be updated to: \u201cBut do you condemn Iran?\u201d As for things genuinely worthy of condemnation, these continue to include, well, genocide in Gaza \u2013 not to mention the brazenly hypocritical Western insistence on Israel\u2019s \u201cright to self-defence\u201d, which ultimately amounts to genocidal apologetics. And as leaders continue to trip over themselves in affirmation of solidarity with Israel after this \u201cunprecedented attack\u201d, we\u2019d all do well to remember that you reap what you sow \u2013 and that Iran is not the aggressor here.",

          "raw_content": "U.S. officials expect Israeli response to Iran strikes will be limited +2 , and U.S. officials expect a possible Israeli response to Iran\u2019s attack over the weekend to be limited in scope and most likely involve strikes against Iranian military forces and Iranian-backed proxies outside Iran, four U.S. officials said. The U.S. assessment is based on conversations between American and Israeli officials that happened before Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night. As Israel was preparing for a possible Iranian attack last week, Israeli officials briefed U.S. officials about possible response options, the U.S. officials said. The U.S. officials stressed that they have not been briefed on Israel\u2019s final decision about how it will respond and that the options could have changed since the weekend attack. They also said it is not clear when an Israeli response will happen, but they said it could happen at any time. Read the full story here. Johnson outlines House plan to vote on foreign aid bills and House Speaker Mike Johnson spoke to reporters after a GOP conference meeting that he said was \u201cfruitful and productive\u201d and outlined his plan to put four national security bills on the House floor: Israel aid, Ukraine aid, Indo-Pacific aid and a fourth measure that includes GOP national security priorities that would include more sanctions on Iran. \u201cEvery member ultimately will be able to vote their own conscience on all of these matters and everyone have an opportunity to weigh in and bring the amendments that they think are suitable,\u201d said Johnson, R-La. He said that he would prefer to send each bill to the Senate individually but that no final decision has been made. If bill text comes out tomorrow, as is the hope, Johnson said, the House might not vote on the packages until Friday. The House is scheduled to leave Thursday afternoon and be in recess next week, but that could change. Iranians anxious as Israel weighs strike response DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The prospect of Israeli retaliation against Iran for its drone and missile attack over the weekend has alarmed many Iranians already facing economic pain and tighter social and political controls after protests in 2022-23. Iran\u2019s political and military leaders have repeatedly warned that they will respond to any Israeli retaliation by escalating further, potentially triggering yet more attacks. And that would only be bad news for ordinary people, said Hesam, 45, a teacher from the northern city of Amol. \u201cEconomic pressure will mount. Our safety will be jeopardized. ... We must avoid conflict at all cost. I don\u2019t want a war. How can I protect my two children? Nowhere will be safe.\u201d Middle- and lower-income Iranians are shouldering much of the burden of the economic woes, with inflation over 50%; rising utility, food and housing prices; and the rial currency falling sharply. Parvaneh, 37, a mother of two in the central city of Yazd, fears an Israeli strike could be the final hammer blow to the economy, weakened by years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption. \u201cWe Iranians have endured more than enough for years. War brings only disaster. My husband is a factory worker. We do not have even enough money to buy staples, let alone stockpile them,\u201d she said. Bilal Saab, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank based in London, says the Iranian strikes on Israel signify that Iran has the ability to potentially mount a more significant attack. Rep. Scalise offers support to Netanyahu in call and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., conveyed support for Israel following Iran's retaliatory strikes over the weekend in a call with Netanyahu today, according to both of their offices. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that Scalise expressed support \"for any decision that Israel makes in light of the Iranian attack.\" \"Majority Leader Scalise informed the Prime Minister of his initiative to advance in Congress, in the coming days, a series of measures against Iran and for Israel; Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked him,\" the statement said. Scalise told Fox News that they spoke about the House agenda this week and that he spoke to Netanyahu about his support for Israel's right to self-defense. \"He truly appreciated the action we\u2019re taking to support Israel and to hold Iran and their terrorist proxies accountable,\" he said. Jordan allowed fighter jets to intercept Iranian drones, Israeli air force official says TEL AVIV \u2014 Jordan allowed Israeli fighter jets into its airspace to intercept Iranian missiles and drones, an Israeli air force official said today. \u201cIn order to address something that comes from the east, we need to fly somewhere that is east of Israel,\u201d the official said in a briefing for reporters. \u201cThis was done with coordination.\u201d While Iran\u2019s direct attack against Israel was unprecedented, so was the scale of coordination between Israel and Jordan, its Arab neighbor, in the response. Jordanian and Israeli fighters \u2014 coordinated by the U.S. military \u2014 acted together to intercept the barrage of drones and missiles. In a statement yesterday, Jordan\u2019s government said the interceptions were made to ensure the safety of its citizens, rather than in defense of Israel. But it is thought to be the first time the two countries\u2019 militaries have fought side by side. Jordan and Israel made peace in 1994, though the relationship has often been strained by disagreements over Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians. U.S. looking to further isolate Iran, Kirby says and The Biden administration is working to \"further isolate\" Iran's regime by increasing economic pressure, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters today. \"That's the upshot here: a stronger Israel, a weaker Iran, a more unified alliance of partners,\" Kirby said. Asked whether the U.S. would support a counterattack from Israel, Kirby told NBC News' Gabe Gutierrez it was a hypothetical question he would not entertain. \"We don\u2019t want to see a wider conflict,\" Kirby said. \"As the president said to the prime minister on Saturday night, we will continue to do what we have to do to help Israel defend itself. But you\u2019re asking me to get ahead of \u2014 as far as I know \u2014 a decision that the war Cabinet hasn\u2019t even made.\" Blinken discusses regional concerns with visiting Iraqi delegation and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani as part of Al-Sudani's official visit to Washington this week, Al-Sudani's office said in a statement. The two officials spoke about strengthening relations between the U.S. and Iraq, as well as potential American investment opportunities, \"especially in the fields of energy,\" the statement said. Regional issues were also a topic, with Al-Sudani reiterating \"Iraq\u2019s clear position on the aggression, stressing the joint legal and moral responsibility for protecting unarmed civilians.\" The statement went on to say Al-Sudani stressed the importance of keeping the conflict from expanding. A statement from Blinken's office was not yet available. Speaking to reporters alongside Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Tamim, he said he was excited to welcome the Iraqi officials to the capital and hoped to \"expand that 360-degree partnership\" between their countries. Both officials warned against escalating tensions in Iran. The covert war between Israel and Iran has exploded into view. What comes next? The bitter conflict between Israel and Iran has long been confined to the realm of secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy. But that largely covert struggle burst into full view over the weekend with Tehran\u2019s retaliatory drone and missile strikes. Iran\u2019s unprecedented direct attack on Israel, which followed its deadly strike on Iran\u2019s consular building in Syria, left the U.S. and its allies scrambling to avoid a wider conflict as the world waits to see what comes next. Netanyahu\u2019s war Cabinet convened today to weigh its options. Western leaders have urged restraint, with Biden warning Netanyahu against carrying out new strikes on Iran and making it clear that Washington would not join in any such counterattack. (Speaking after the war Cabinet convened, an Israeli official told NBC News that a response may be \u201cimminent.\u201d) While Israel took down almost all the drones and missiles used in the attack, the U.S. and other allied countries, the stakes after the attack could not be higher. In the eyes of some foreign policy hawks, the attacks could be perceived as a grave provocation that demands a furious rejoinder. But other analysts have warned that if Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war amid Israel\u2019s devastating monthslong military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Read the full story here. Iran's response will be 'more extensive' if Israel counters, foreign minister told Cameron and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned that if Israel launches an attack, the regime's next response will be \"immediate, stronger and more extensive.\" In a call with U.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron yesterday, Amirabdollahian reiterated Tehran's position that the assault on Israel was within the country's legal right to respond to the strike on its diplomatic building and blamed the region's tensions on \"the destructive role of the occupying Israeli regime,\" according to a state news report. Cameron confirmed his call with Amirabdollahian on X, saying he formally condemned Iran's retaliatory strike on Israel. He also discussed the Revolutionary Guard's seizure of a Portuguese-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz. \"I made clear that Iran must stop these reckless attacks, de-escalate and release the MSC Aries,\" Cameron wrote. Biden addresses Iran attack during meeting with visiting Iraqi prime minister Biden took a moment to address Iran\u2019s \u201cunprecedented aerial attack\u201d against Israel. He said the U.S. and its allies were able to \u201cdefeat\u201d the attack during a meeting with the prime minister of Iraq. Bedouin girl severely injured during Iranian missile attack is still in intensive care, her father says +3 , , and The father of 7-year-old Amina al-Hasoni describes the chaos of the middle-of-the-night attack from Iran that left his daughter with a severe head injury from shrapnel. Her injuries are the most severe casualty of the Iranian onslaught, according to Israeli authorities, as Israel's defense system was able to thwart most of the missiles and drones headed toward Israeli territory. \"We heard the rocket exploding over our heads. We didn\u2019t know where to go, there was a lot of shouting and a lot of chaos,\" Amina's father, Mohammed al-Hasoni, told NBC News by phone Monday. He said Amina is still in intensive care in a hospital in Be'er Sheva in southern Israel. The Hasoni family lives in a Bedouin community in southern Israel. Bedouin communities number around 300,000, with very few of the resources enjoyed by other Israeli towns and cities, including bomb shelters that might have saved Amina's life, as was first reported by The New York Times. \"Amina has nothing to do with all that is happening [in the world], with this reality,\" her father said. \"I just want peace.\" Oil prices fall after Iran\u2019s strike on Israel is thwarted Oil prices fell on Monday after Iran\u2019s missile and drone strike failed to cause widespread damage in Israel and the U.S. made it clear it did not support a wider war with Iran. Analysts say the chief risk to oil prices from the Israel-Hamas war would be if the conflict escalates and disrupts oil supplies from Iran and Persian Gulf producers through the Strait of Hormuz choke point. Tougher sanctions enforcement against Iranian oil shipments by the U.S. could raise oil prices but would risk higher inflation and pump prices for U.S. motorists in an election year. The stance taken by Iran, which said the matter \u201ccan be deemed concluded\u201d with the retaliatory strikes, and the U.S. position reassured oil traders, who sent the price of international benchmark Brent crude 0.7% lower to $89.82 a barrel in Monday morning trading. That is below the levels just above $90 a barrel seen on Friday before the weekend attacks. Risks that could send prices higher include any Israeli strike against Iranian oil facilities or tougher enforcement of sanctions against Iran by the U.S. Israel\u2019s response to the Iranian attack may be 'imminent,' official says TEL AVIV \u2014 Israel\u2019s response to the Iranian attack may be \"imminent,\" an Israeli official said Monday.

          "raw_content": "Geoff Bennett: Today, the British and German foreign ministers visited Israel and urged the government to show restraint. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said only Israel will decide how to respond to last weekend's unprecedented Iranian missile and drone attack. And Israeli officials have indicated they will respond. Nick Schifrin speaks to experts now about what that action might look like and how it will affect the region \u2014 Nick. Nick Schifrin: For decades, Geoff, Israel and Iran have fought one another in the shadows and through proxies, until Saturday night, when Iran launched the first ever state-on-state attack between these two countries, with more than 300 missiles and drones flown from Iran toward Israel. That attack was a response to an Israeli strike in Damascus that killed senior Iranian commanders. What will Israel do next and what might Iran do in response? We get two views. Eric Edelman served as U.S. ambassador to Turkey and was undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration. He's now at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute. And Vali Nasr was a special adviser in the State Department during the Obama administration. He's now a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Eric Edelman, Vali Nasr, thanks very much. Welcome, both of you, back to the \"NewsHour.\" Eric Edelman, let me start with you. As Geoff just said, this attack by Iran was unprecedented. Do you expect Israel to retaliate in a significant kind of way? And should they? Eric Edelman, Former State Department and Defense Department Official: Well, I think Israel has no choice but to respond, Nick. This was, as you said, unprecedented, but the scale of this attack is what's really sort of breathtaking, very large attack with both ballistic cruise missiles and UAVs, clearly meant to overwhelm Israel's layered air defenses. And I think it is impossible for Israel not to strike back in some way. But Israel is in a quandary, because part of its success in inflicting a pretty humiliating defeat on what is one of the main tools of coercion available to the Iranian regime was through the work of its allies, including the U.S. coordinating a lot of efforts with CENTCOM, also the U.K., France, but also Arab partners. And Israel doesn't want to alienate them. So the calls for restraint are clearly having an impact. The Israeli war cabinet has met, I think, four times now trying to determine exactly how to respond. And it's a difficult decision for them. Nick Schifrin: Vali Nasr, is that how you see this strike, breathtaking scale designed to overwhelm Israeli and allied defenses? Vali Nasr, School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University: I think Eric's analysis is actually correct. So what we have been seeing is that the rules of the game have been significantly shifting with every attack and counterattack. So Israel hitting the consulate in Damascus was viewed by Iran as sort of a new sort of red line that Israel crossed. Iran's attack on Israel is significant, not only in terms of the number of missiles that were used, but that it was also launched from Iranian territory. It was done in a brazen way. And the doctrine that went with it is that, from now on, if you attack Iran, we attack you directly. Now, how Israel responds to this \u2014 and I do agree with Eric that, both for domestic political reasons and for strategic reasons, it's very, very difficult to see a scenario in which Israel would not react, could also, if you would cross, another red line. So we're in an escalatory cycle where the rules of the shadow war are no longer holding. And with each of these attacks, we may be crossing a new Rubicon, and that eventually can open \u2014 end up in an open conflict. Eric Edelman: Well, I mean, I think that Israel has many, many tools at its disposal. And one of the things I think that's asymmetry here is that the very complex, layered defense that Israel has available to it is not something that Iran has. I think Israel has lots of ways, including nonkinetic ways with cyber, to inflict real costs, impose real costs on the Iranian regime in a way that does reset deterrence without actually getting into the kind of escalatory spiral that Vali was discussing, which I agree is a possibility. But, right now, I think this was a very \u2014 should be a very disturbing defeat for the Iranian regime. The fact that I think that they're concerned about it has been demonstrated by the crackdown on domestic dissent that we have seen in the last 48, 72 hours. And, right now, it's not even clear that they could launch a second volley, since they may have used up a lot of their medium-range ballistic missiles in the first go-round. And the failure rate may have been as high as 50 percent. So if you're sitting in Tehran, I think you might be more worried about an escalatory cycle than Israel is right now. Vali Nasr: I think it's both. In other words, definitely, there's bluster, but there's also definitely very tough rhetoric in order to dissuade Israel from doing something that would then force the Iranians to escalate. But I would say that exactly the ambiguities that exist here, what can the Iranians do, how afraid are they, would they react, at what level they react, is exactly why Israel is pondering its response and why you have two foreign ministers visiting Israel in order to ask Israel to restrain itself. But, partly, this is not entirely a military issue. It's not a question of just what fail rate Israel's missiles had, but the way in which this crisis over the last 10 days impacted global markets, impacted psychologically Israel, economically, but also the way in which the United States and Europe reacted to the urgency of the situation basically does give Iran a certain leverage here. In other words, once Israel attacks Iran, we don't know when Iran would react, but we may go through another 10 days, 15 days of this sort of thing. And then, if the Iranians decide to react, and then Israel reacts to Iran's reaction, essentially, Israel and Iran are not \u2014 no longer the only two parties that are affected by this crisis. The global economy, the Arab governments around them, Europe and the United States are affected, and they're quite worried. And that's also a factor that's playing in here as well.",

Legislation (Strength: 5)**: The E.U.'s progress on AI legislation may pressure U.S. lawmakers to introduce similar measures, including those targeting LLMs.\n3. **High-Profile Lawsuits (Strength: 6)**: The New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft could bring significant attention to the issue, prompting legislative action.\n4. **Broader Tech Regulation Momentum (Strength: 5)**: The ongoing scrutiny of tech companies by Congress, including hearings on social media harms, indicates a growing momentum for tech regulation that could extend to LLMs.\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe competing factors suggest a nuanced landscape for the potential introduction of legislation specifically targeting LLMs in 2024. On the one hand, the lack of a specific focus on LLMs in current legislative discussions and the preference for an incentive-based approach reduce the likelihood of such legislation. Additionally, the complexity of defining and regulating LLMs and the influence of tech industry lobbying further diminish this probability.\n\nOn the other hand, emerging concerns in sectors like healthcare, the influence of E.U. legislation, high-profile lawsuits, and the broader momentum for tech regulation provide some counterbalance. These factors suggest that while specific LLM-focused legislation is not the primary focus, there is a non-negligible chance that the issue could gain traction, especially if driven by external pressures or significant events like lawsuits.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability of a member of the U.S. Congress introducing legislation specifically limiting the use of LLMs in 2024 is moderate but not high. The factors against such legislation appear stronger and more immediate than those in favor, but the latter cannot be entirely discounted.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.35</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of new, specific tech legislation being introduced in a given year. Historically, the introduction of highly specific tech legislation, especially in emerging fields like AI, tends to be gradual and often follows broader regulatory trends rather than leading them. The current legislative environment, with its focus on broader AI and tech regulation, suggests that while specific LLM legislation is possible, it is not highly probable.\n\nAdditionally, the influence of high-profile lawsuits and external pressures like E.U. legislation could increase the probability slightly, but these factors are more likely to contribute to broader AI regulatory efforts rather than specific LLM-focused legislation.\n\nConsidering these points and ensuring a balanced view of the competing factors, the initial probability of 0.35 seems reasonable but slightly high. Adjusting for the base rate and the strength of the factors against specific LLM legislation, a more conservative estimate is warranted.\n\nFinal probability: *0.30*\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.30*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "Policymakers in Brussels were locked in late-night negotiations Wednesday to reach a deal on the world\u2019s most ambitious law to regulate artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, senators signaled that the U.S. Congress is taking a divergent approach from the European Union on the emerging technology, with lawmakers raising concerns that the bloc\u2019s approach could be heavy-handed and risk alienating AI developers. The marathon dealmaking dragged into Thursday morning Brussels time and will resume again on Friday morning, according to E.U. Commissioner Thierry Breton. The split-screen events on either side of the Atlantic underscore the challenges of regulating artificial intelligence, a rising priority for governments around the world in the year since the release of the AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT sparked a global frenzy. Advertisement Congress lags far behind its counterparts in Brussels, where a framework to regulate AI was first proposed in 2021. But after years of work, the future of the E.U.\u2019s AI legislation remains uncertain amid a lobbying blitz and opposition from the E.U.\u2019s largest nations \u2014 France, Germany and Italy. Schumer launches \u2018all hands on deck\u2019 push to regulate AI After more than half a year of work on AI policy, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters that the bipartisan group was \u201cstarting to really begin to work on legislation,\u201d though he offered few specifics about what such a bill would include. The comments came during Congress\u2019s last two AI forums of 2023, where lawmakers huddled with top tech executives, including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, to better understand topics including the risks of an AI doomsday and national security. Advertisement Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a member of the bipartisan working group that Schumer assembled to craft AI policy, said the senators are pursuing an \u201cincentive-based\u201d approach in an effort to retain AI developers in the United States. \u201cIf [European policymakers] look at this as a regulatory activity, they will chase AI development to the United States,\u201d he told reporters after the pair of forums. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to is to chase AI development to our adversaries.\u201d Europe moves ahead on AI regulation, challenging tech giants\u2019 power Meanwhile, officials in the European Union sought a late-stage breakthrough on the E.U. AI Act, which would largely take a \u201crisk-based\u201d approach to limiting the uses of AI applications based on how dangerous lawmakers predict they could be. Representatives of the European Parliament are scrambling to counter attempts by the largest nations in the 27-member bloc to water down the historic bill. In recent weeks, talks between the different bodies of the E.U. \u2014 the European Commission, which proposes laws, and the European Council and European Parliament, which adopt them \u2014 have become plagued by divisions that have jeopardized an act years in the making. Officials went into the negotiations optimistic that a compromise could be reached, and talks were still ongoing as it approached midnight in Brussels. Advertisement If no agreement is reached, negotiations would probably move to a last-ditch effort in January, after which experts say it may be difficult to get any bill passed ahead of European Parliament elections in June. \u201cIf we go beyond January, I think we are lost,\u201d said Brando Benifei, one of two lawmakers running lead on the act in the European Parliament. \u201cIt will be at least another nine months before we could have the AI Act.\u201d The E.U.\u2019s largest nations have sought to remove a part of the bill that would impose binding regulations and transparency rules on foundation models, like the technology underlying ChatGPT, which generates answers based on models trained by scraping data from across the internet. Arguing that hose rules could stifle innovation and put Europe further behind the United States in the race to develop such models, those countries were instead pushing for industry self-regulation. Advertisement People familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of the anonymity to describe delicate negotiations said France appeared to be the strongest obstacle to a deal, based in part on its desire to protect a burgeoning company developing AI foundation models, Paris-based Mistral, as well as other French AI firms. A bid to limit AI in police work, meanwhile, comes as France is set to deploy AI-powered smart cameras for policing and security at the 2024 Summer Olympics and as French cities have already entered legal gray areas by deploying or testing such technology. Asked about French opposition, France\u2019s digital minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, said that European governments broadly opposed restrictions on AI use for policing and national security, and that onerous regulations on foundation model developers could seriously hinder European innovation. \u201cThere is a unanimous consensus within the council that the use of AI for national security purposes should not be included in the regulation,\u201d he said. Advertisement He added, \u201cThe [AI] industry in Europe has expressed its concerns that adding too much of a burden on the shoulders of foundational model developers was equivalent to not having those models developed in Europe,\u201d he said. Barrot insisted that even the kind of compromise being sought by the French would still result in the world\u2019s strongest law governing AI. He called the bill a beginning, as opposed to an end, of European regulations on the technology. \u201cI dare anyone to present me with a piece of regulation that is as tough as the E.U. AI Act around the world,\u201d he said. Going into Wednesday\u2019s negotiating session, Benifei said the push by France and other countries to allow industry to self-regulate would nix one of the most important elements of the bill, arguing that a compromise imposing real restrictions must be found. \u201cThe most powerful models will become the basis of all AI,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we regulate their security and their transparency on how they work and data \u2026 used to train them, then we will make it safer for all AI systems down the chain.\u201d",

          "raw_content": "The New York Times recently sued Microsoft and OpenAI, claiming that their AI services, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, have unlawfully utilized the New York Times\u2019 content and demanding they dismantle all large language models (LLMs) trained on its articles. However, the newspaper\u2019s complaint misrepresents how LLMs function and selectively uses examples to construct a narrative that appeals to moral sensibilities yet fails to establish a solid legal argument. Moreover, The New York Times\u2019 proposed remedy would erase nearly every existing LLM, halting a technology poised to deliver significant advancements to society. While the courts will likely eventually side against The New York Times, if publishers take their fight to Congress, policymakers should be prepared to uphold the right of AI developers to train AI systems using publicly accessible data on the Internet. Like other unsuccessful lawsuits from content creators against developers of LLMs, this case is motivated more by fear of being replaced by AI, rather than a solid interpretation of copyright law. At the heart of the lawsuit is the Times\u2019 accusation that LLMs are \u201cmass copying\u201d machines that, when prompted, \u201cwill output near-verbatim copies of significant portions of Times\u2019 works.\u201d However, as OpenAI has rightly argued, training of LLMs with content publicly available on the Internet comes under the fair use principle, given the transformative nature of this process. Just as people are permitted to learn and develop writing skills and produce work by studying existing copyright-protected works, LLMs should be afforded the same opportunity. Moreover, the Times\u2019 argument that LLMs merely replicate content verbatim oversimplifies and misrepresents the complex mechanisms underlying these AI models. Far from merely memorizing and regurgitating data, LLMs synthesize vast amounts of information to build probabilistic models that predict likely text sequences. While the Times\u2019 has pointed out instances where LLMs reproduced parts of their popular articles like \u201cSnow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek,\u201d a simple Google search for the article reveals multiple online sources containing large portions of the same article. The presence of widely copied material online can lead to its occasional replication by LLMs. However, this does not indicate a systematic problem within LLMs, as evidenced by ChatGPT\u2019s inability to replicate less popular Times articles verbatim in the Times\u2019 tests. The application of copyright law hinges significantly on the context and purpose of the alleged copying. The concept of \u201cfair use,\u201d particularly when using works for research or to enable technological advancement, is a well-established principle. For example, Google\u2019s use of book snippets in its search results is an example of the fair use principle in practice. The transformative nature of LLM model-making and its diverse applications are markedly different from the original intent of publishing news articles. LLMs serve diverse functions ranging from translation and coding assistance to essay writing and grammar support. An example of this diverse application is ChatGPT\u2019s successful diagnosis of a rare disease in a boy, a challenge that had stumped 17 doctors. This instance vividly demonstrates the unique capabilities of LLMs in fields well beyond the journalistic intent of news articles. Another important aspect of this debate is the perceived threat that AI poses to traditional news outlets like The New York Times. The lawsuit suggests that AI models could undermine the Times\u2019 paywall by providing similar content. However, these AI systems neither claim to replicate the Times\u2019 content nor do they directly compete as a source of news. AI, which lacks human reasoning and judgment, cannot fully replicate the nuances and depth of analysis that reputable journalism offers. The Times\u2019 longstanding reputation for credibility and authoritative reporting is something that AI, in its current state, cannot challenge. Hence, when it comes to current news, LLMs will not reduce the market for traditional news. Further, OpenAI has established a policy allowing website owners to block their content from being used in AI model training. It was not until August 2023 that the New York Times updated its terms and conditions to restrict the use of its content for AI training. In the case of the New York Times\u2019 archive of articles on various topics, there will be instances where LLMs are in direct competition. For example, if one were researching the important technological innovations of this century, they could go to the archives of a newspaper or ask an LLM. However, copyright law does not extend its protection to facts and ideas. Furthermore, when a user makes that query, LLMs are not using the archives of a single news organization; rather, they are predicting a word at a time based on the innumerous writings on various technological innovations of this century. Throughout history, emerging technologies have faced resistance. The initial resistance to the printing press, for instance, mirrors The New York Times\u2019 apprehensions about AI. Yet, just as the printing press revolutionized information dissemination and led to societal progress, AI also promises similar transformative potential. Additionally, the 1920s saw the rise of commercial broadcast radio, a powerful new technology in mass communication, which created significant disruption in the news industry. Newspapers, once dominant, faced a crisis as consumers and advertisers increasingly turned to radio. In a more recent parallel, traditional news media have directly accused platforms like Google and Facebook of exploiting local news content for their own profit. Each of these technological advancements initially disrupted established media but eventually led to a richer, more varied media ecosystem. This ongoing pattern highlights a critical theme: the constant evolution of technology inevitably challenges established media, necessitating adaptation and innovation. The integration of AI in content creation and consumption is the latest iteration of this historical progression, promising to add new dimensions to how information is processed, presented, and accessed.",

          "raw_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) presents big opportunities and potential risks for countries around the globe, and India is no exception. India has a vast, burgeoning high-tech labor force. The country also attracts millions of dollars in foreign direct investments, putting it on pace to become a major player in the global technology supply chain. With this growth, AI technologies are, and will, make their way into numerous Indian industries, such as healthcare, technology, the workforce, and education, forcing the Indian government to take steps toward regulating AI. In recent publications, we discussed US President Joseph Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI and the compromise reached on an AI act among representatives of the EU Council, European Parliament, and European Commission. Similar to these global counterparts, the Indian government recognizes AI\u2019s potential to have a sweeping impact on society, including negative impacts such as bias and privacy violations. In the last several years, India has introduced initiatives and guidelines for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, but there are currently no specific laws regulating AI in India. Defining Principles and Frameworks The Indian government tasked the NITI Aayog, its apex public policy think tank, with establishing guidelines and policies for the development and use of AI. In 2018, the NITI Aayog released the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence #AIForAll strategy, which featured AI research and development guidelines focused on healthcare, agriculture, education, \u201csmart\u201d cities and infrastructure, and smart mobility and transformation. In February 2021, the NITI Aayog released Part 1 - Principles for Responsible AI, an approach paper that explores the various ethical considerations of deploying AI solutions in India, divided into system considerations and societal considerations. While the system considerations mostly deal with the overall principles behind decision-making, rightful inclusion of beneficiaries, and accountability of AI decisions, societal considerations focus on the impact of automation on job creation and employment. In August 2021, the NITI Aayog released Part 2 - Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI, which focuses on operationalizing principles for responsible AI. The report breaks down the actions that need to be taken by both the government and the private sector, in partnership with research institutes, to cover regulatory and policy interventions, capacity building, incentivizing ethics by design, and creating frameworks for compliance with relevant AI standards. The government of India also recently enacted a new privacy law, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act in 2023, which it can leverage to address some of the privacy concerns concerning AI platforms. Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence and International Collaboration Additionally, India is a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI). The 2023 GPAI Summit was recently held in New Delhi, where GPAI experts presented their work on responsible AI, data governance, and the future of work, innovation, and commercialization. The GPAI website provides that \u201cas a vital branch of the initiative, GPAI\u2019s Experts produce deliverables that can be integrated into Members\u2019 national strategies to ensure the inclusive and sustainable development of AI. Under the 2023 themes of climate change, global health and societal resilience, Experts worked to ensure that AI is used responsibly to address current challenges around the world. GPAI\u2019s Members, on the other hand, adopted the 2023 Ministerial Declaration, reaffirming their commitment to the trustworthy stewardship of AI in line with the OECD AI Principles, as well as their dedication to implementing those principles through the development of regulations, policies, standards and other initiatives. In doing so, they highlighted efforts to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and advance AI that is responsible, sustainable, and inclusive for all.\u201d Other Indian agencies are also working on AI policies for the country, including the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which has created committees on AI that have submitted reports on the development, safety, and ethical issues related to AI. The Bureau of Indian Standards, which is the national standards body of India, has also established a committee on AI that is proposing draft Indian standards for AI. While the government of India has taken steps to regulate AI, its approach has mainly been one of pro-innovation with the development of policies and guidelines that acknowledge the ethical concerns and risks around the use of AI that may require the adoption of best practices. Given India\u2019s advantage of having a robust software development industry, this approach makes sense until the government formally enacts AI regulations. International Opportunities The AI landscape in India is continuously evolving. Uncertainty, however, has not stopped both local and international interest and growth in this space. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. announced a partnership with an India-based AI company, 114ai, to develop advanced technology for complex military systems. In September 2023, the US-based chip firm NVIDIA Corporation announced partnerships with Indian conglomerates Reliance Industries Ltd. and Tata group to develop cloud infrastructure and language models, wherein NVIDIA will provide the computing power required for building a cloud AI infrastructure platform. An entity looking to enter the AI space in India should carefully consider the best legal route for such entry, whether through a joint venture, a strategic alliance, or a wholly owned subsidiary. Each route can be leveraged, and structures can be put in place depending on the level of investment and control required by the investing foreign entity. This is particularly important in a dynamic space like AI, where regulation is continuously evolving. Issues such as liability for harm caused, rights to intellectual property for AI systems, and privacy and data protection have not been fully fleshed out in regulations. Therefore, entities looking to enter this space should carefully consider the best legal and contractual protections. How We Can Help",

          "raw_content": "Although not a new concept, generative AI is a popular buzzword. With new capabilities, this technology has the potential to radically transform healthcare. From its ability to create first drafts for email responses to its promise of automating rudimentary coding, there are countless ways it can be deployed to boost productivity, improve accuracy, and support better decision-making. Despite its potential, generative AI technologies have well-known risks around data privacy and data accuracy. These risks make adoption in highly regulated industries like financial services, insurance, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare particularly complicated. Several concerns have recently made news. Italy\u2019s data protection watchdog banned OpenAI in March 2023 due to suspected European Union General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) violations and concerns over its lack of age-gating. The ban was reversed in late April. But other countries\u2019 privacy and data watchdogs have also raised concerns\u2014including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, which held hearings on generative AI in May. To address these concerns, a number of regulations are emerging to govern the use of generative AI, including the EU\u2019s AI Act1, which regulates products that are high risk, and President Biden\u2019s work towards developing an AI Bill of Rights.2 Many industries will also need to look to their sector\u2019s existing data privacy regulations to govern how they adopt the technology. In this paper, we\u2019ll examine generative AI\u2019s data privacy and data accuracy risks by looking at the challenges the highly regulated healthcare industry might face in adoption. We\u2019ll examine the risks with generative AI, look at potential use cases, and discuss ways organizations can mitigate and tackle roadblocks to generative AI adoption in any sector. Data Accuracy Risks The emerging AI technology that many industries are looking to adopt involves large language models (LLMs), the type of generative AI model that powers ChatGPT. These models train on large unlabeled datasets. The goal of their training is to help the models understand the connections between words\u2014which the systems represent as an algorithmic equation. After this unsupervised training is complete, these models are often extensively fine-tuned via supervised learning or techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), to help the model better understand misinformation in its dataset and what kinds of responses are preferred. To create ChatGPT, for example, OpenAI hired 6,000 annotators to label an appropriate subset of data. The company\u2019s machine learning engineers then used that data to fine-tune the model to teach it to generate specific kinds of replies. Despite these efforts toward data accuracy, the way that LLMs work\u2014essentially by predicting the next likely word in a sentence\u2014means that the models are prone to what\u2019s often called \u201challucinations.\u201d AI hallucinations are the false information that LLMs often generate, either in response to a straightforward question or when given disinformation in a prompt. For example, an LLM might say that a famous actor was born in the wrong year, starred in movies that don\u2019t exist, or is married when the actor is actually single. It might also claim that the Golden Gate Bridge is in Italy if asked where in Europe it\u2019s located. While that sort of misinformation doesn\u2019t have life-or-death consequences, misinformation in certain use cases for AI in the healthcare sector could. For example, using generative AI to help with diagnostics or treatment recommendations could open up liability issues if a patient was misdiagnosed or a model exhibited bias, another common problem. Other issues could also emerge in instances where ineffective prompts might lead to inaccurate responses. This could be a problem in cases where health systems rely on chatbots to help patients decide what kind of medical professional to contact for a particular complaint. Also, general purpose LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 that are trained on a broad dataset don\u2019t have a significant amount of medical literature in their training set. They are not designed for clinical care delivery and are a bad fit for many types of use cases in healthcare compared to more niche models trained on a higher percentage of medical literature. Still, LLMs show exciting potential for certain uses in healthcare. Tasks like answering patient queries, helping manage healthcare workflows, assisting in scheduling appointments, sending personalized reminders, providing aftercare instructions, writing doctors\u2019 notes, and supporting healthcare professionals in decision-making could work well so long as the data accuracy issues can be appropriately monitored. Generative AI, with its ability to create synthetic data and content, presents challenges of misrepresentation or misuse of information. However, its potential for diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, or accelerating drug discovery is noteworthy. Adopting robust data governance, thorough vetting processes, and maintaining transparency can help mitigate these risks, enabling broader and safer adoption of generative AI across sectors. Data Privacy Risks Data accuracy issues in LLMs might create liability in healthcare if the wrong information is given out. Still, the more salient concerns for the sector are expected to be the data privacy risks associated with LLMs. Currently, many AI models employ user-input data as part of their training data, analyzing that data without human input and drawing their own conclusions. Even if AI companies try to anonymize that user data, it\u2019s not always effective. Unredacted and unencrypted data could be seen by the AI company\u2019s employees, could surface in prompts, or could even be part of a data breach, as happened in March3 when some OpenAI users could see titles from other users\u2019 chat history. Although OpenAI\u2019s application programming interfaces (APIs) demonstrate a commitment to security standards, with Systems and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2 compliance, and facilitate clients\u2019 HIPAA compliance via business associate agreements, numerous other LLMs still need to achieve this regulatory standard in healthcare. Some prominent LLMs include GPT-3 and Transformer models, Microsoft\u2019s Turing-NLG, Google\u2019s Meena, and T5. These LLMs offer advanced natural language processing capabilities beneficial to healthcare, such as interpreting medical documents or patient interactions. However, despite these advantages, until these models achieve necessary compliance, their utility in healthcare remains limited, underscoring the need for LLMs to align with regulatory requirements for broader healthcare applications. Healthcare providers must avoid AI tools that haven\u2019t been approved by their health system as meeting requirements for storing protected health information (PHI) and compliance with HIPAA, along with any applicable state privacy laws. Healthcare entities should also update their policies and procedures when it comes to privacy and security to ensure that they\u2019re accessing PHI in compliant ways when leveraging generative AI. Tackling Generative AI\u2019s Privacy and Accuracy Risks Today Despite these risks, there are ways healthcare organizations interested in implementing generative AI today can remain compliant and optimize the advantages offered by these promising technologies. The first thing to do is to ensure you fully understand the benefits and drawbacks of the LLMs being used. While similar, each model performs better on specific tasks and topics depending on its training and dataset. Ways to use LLMs more safely and effectively in the healthcare sector today: Fine-tune a general model on additional data Seek out a specialty LLM model focused on healthcare use cases Refine a specialty model on data specific to your use case Limit use of LLMs to use cases where accuracy isn\u2019t critical Combine LLMs with other AI models to enhance capabilities, for example, integrating with image recognition AI for improved diagnostics Get explicit patient consent for care or communication that involves generative AI Continually monitor the performance of the LLMs to ensure they are working as intended and making accurate predictions or interpretations Tackling Generative AI\u2019s Privacy and Accuracy Risks in the Future What does the future hold for risk management in generative AI? As the field matures, expect many of the regulatory issues that are currently stumbling blocks to adoption in certain sectors to be addressed, opening the field to broader industrial use. Healthcare organizations looking to adopt generative AI technologies to transform their workflows or services must navigate privacy concerns, data accuracy risks, and regulatory requirements, while updating processes and policies to accommodate this new technology.

          "raw_content": "It has been nearly 40 years since the Supreme Court indicated in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council that courts should defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. After more than three-and-a-half hours of oral argument on Wednesday, it seemed unlikely that the rule outlined in that case, known as the Chevron doctrine, will survive in its current form. A majority of the justices seemed ready to jettison the doctrine or at the very least significantly limit it. The court\u2019s ruling could have ripple effects across the federal government, where agencies frequently use highly trained experts to interpret and implement federal laws. Although the doctrine was relatively noncontroversial when it was first introduced in 1984, in recent years conservatives \u2013 including some members of the Supreme Court \u2013 have called for it to be overruled. The plea to overturn the Chevron doctrine came to the court in two cases challenging a rule, issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service, that requires the herring industry to bear the costs of observers on fishing boats. Applying Chevron, both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld the rule, finding it to be a reasonable interpretation of federal law. The fishing companies came to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to weigh in on the rule itself but also to overrule Chevron. Roman Martinez, representing one group of fishing vessels, told the justices that the Chevron doctrine undermines the duty of courts to say what the law is and violates the federal law governing administrative agencies, which similarly requires courts to undertake a fresh review of legal questions. Under the Chevron doctrine, he observed, even if all nine Supreme Court justices agree that the fishing vessels\u2019 interpretation of federal fishing law is better than the NMFS\u2019s interpretation, they would still be required to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation as long as it was reasonable. Such a result, Martinez concluded, is \u201cnot consistent with the rule of law.\u201d Arguing on behalf of the second group of fishing companies, Paul Clement echoed Martinez\u2019s points. Emphasizing that his clients\u2019 case \u201cwell illustrates the real world costs of the Chevron\u201d doctrine for small businesses, he decried the doctrine as \u201chopeless ambiguous\u201d and \u201creliance destroying.\u201d The question in this challenge to the rule, he said should focus on what the best reading of the statute is. Representing the Biden administration, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar urged the justices to leave the Chevron doctrine in place, telling them that it has \u201cdeep roots in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\u201d Under the doctrine of stare decisis \u2013 the idea that courts should generally adhere to their prior cases \u2013 the court would need a \u201ctruly extraordinary justification\u201d to overrule it, which the challengers do not have, she asserted. The court\u2019s three liberal justices expressed support for keeping the doctrine in place. Justice Elena Kagan repeatedly suggested that federal agencies, with their scientific and technical expertise, are better suited than courts to resolve ambiguities in a federal statute. Kagan cited as one example a hypothetical bill to regulate artificial intelligence. Congress, she said, \u201cknows there are going to be gaps because Congress can hardly see a week in the future.\u201d So it would want people \u201cwho actually know about AI and are accountable to the political process to make decisions\u201d about artificial intelligence. Courts, she emphasized, \u201cdon\u2019t even know what the questions are about AI,\u201d much less the answers. Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with Kagan. She doubted whether there can be a \u201cbest\u201d interpretation of a law when the justices \u201croutinely disagree\u201d about a law\u2019s meaning. The real question, she said, is who makes the choice about what an ambiguous law means. And if the court needs a \u201ctie-breaker,\u201d she continued, why shouldn\u2019t it defer to the agency, with its expertise? Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson posited that the Chevron doctrine serves an important purpose. Under Chevron, she suggested, Congress gives federal agencies the power to make policy choices \u2013 such as filling gaps or defining terms in the statute. But if Chevron is overturned and agencies no longer have that power, she predicted, then courts will have to make those kinds of policy decisions. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh saw Chevron\u2019s deference to agencies differently. Chevron, he complained, \u201cushers in shocks to the system every four or eight years when a new administration comes in\u201d and implements \u201cmassive change\u201d in areas like securities law, communications law, and environmental law. Justice Neil Gorsuch told Prelogar that he was less concerned about businesses subject to changing regulations, observing that the companies \u201ccan take care of themselves\u201d and seek relief through the political process. Instead, Gorsuch pointed to less powerful individuals who may be affected by the actions of federal agencies, such as immigrants, veterans seeking benefits, and Social Security claimants. In those cases, Gorsuch stressed, Chevron virtually always works for the agencies and against the \u201clittle guy.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito pressed Prelogar to explain when a statute would be ambiguous, triggering the application of the Chevron doctrine. He observed that \u201cin cases that don\u2019t involve an agency,\u201d courts do not simply throw up their hands and declare that they cannot determine what the statute means. \u201cSo that would seem to suggest that you never get to step two\u201d of the Chevron test, requiring courts to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. The justices and advocates also debated what the impact of a decision overruling Chevron would be. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that the effect might be relatively minimal, noting that the Supreme Court had not relied on Chevron in several years. Martinez countered that the issue still arises frequently in the lower courts, but he insisted that overruling Chevron would not call prior cases relying on Chevron into question. But Prelogar pushed back, telling the justices that thousands of rulings \u201cwould be open to challenge.\u201d \u201cLitigants,\u201d she said, \u201cwill come out of the woodwork.\u201d Prelogar suggested that the court could follow the path that it chose five years ago in Kisor v. Wilkie, in which the justices declined to overrule a long line of cases instructing courts to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, a doctrine sometimes known as Auer deference. Instead, a splintered court put limits on when Auer deference should apply going forward. In this case, Prelogar told the justices, the court could \u201cclarify and articulate the limits of Chevron deference without taking the drastic step of upending decades of settled precedent.\u201d For example, she explained, the justices could \u201creemphasize\u201d that, in determining whether the statute is clear, courts should use all of the interpretative tools at their disposal and not \u201cgive up just because the statute is dense or hard to parse.\u201d And if the statute is still determined to be ambiguous, she said, the question whether it is reasonable should be \u201cobviously deferential\u201d but \u201cnot just anything goes.\u201d Martinez rejected any suggestion that the Chevron doctrine should be limited but not overruled. The justices, he said, should \u201crecognize that the fundamental problem is Chevron itself.\u201d By the time the session drew to a close, it seemed \u2013 but was not completely clear \u2013 that a majority of the justices agreed with him.",

          "raw_content": "Congress will again grill the chief executives of several big tech companies this week, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, about potential harms from their products on teens. Until now, the social platforms have largely had the same response: We\u2019ll help teens and families make smart decisions themselves. But now, with growing claims that social media can hurt young users, including worries that it risks driving them to depression or even suicide, online safety advocates say that response falls far short. And with a presidential election looming \u2014 and state lawmakers stealing the spotlight from their federal counterparts \u2014 Congress is set to press tech companies to go beyond the tools they\u2019ve rolled out in the past. The chief executives of TikTok, Snap, Discord and X are set to testify alongside Zuckerberg at Wednesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. For some, including X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Discord CEO Jason Citron, Wednesday\u2019s hearing marks their first-ever testimony in front of Congress. Many of the tech CEOs are likely to use Wednesday\u2019s hearing to tout tools and policies to protect children and give parents more control over their kids\u2019 online experiences. Some companies, such as Snap and Discord, told CNN they plan to distance themselves from the likes of Meta by emphasizing they do not focus on serving users algorithmically recommended content in potentially addictive or harmful ways. However, parents and online safety advocacy groups say many of the tools released by social media platforms don\u2019t go far enough \u2014 largely leaving the job of protecting teens up to parents and, in some cases, the young users themselves \u2014 and that tech platforms can no longer be left to self-regulate. \u201cWhat the committee needs to do is to push these executives to commit to major changes, especially to disconnect their advertising and marketing systems from services that are known to attract and target youth,\u201d said Jeff Chester, executive director of online consumer protection nonprofit the Center for Digital Democracy. And the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence tools \u2014 which can give bad actors new ways to create and spread malicious content on social media \u2014 only raises the stakes for ensuring tech platforms have safety features built in by default. Are the kids alright? Several major platforms \u2014 including Meta, Snapchat, Discord and TikTok \u2014 have rolled out oversight tools that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens\u2019 to get information about how they\u2019re using the platforms and have some control over their experience. Some platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, also introduced \u201ctake a break\u201d reminders or screentime limits for teens and tweaked their algorithms to avoid sending teens down rabbit holes of harmful content, such as self harm or eating disorder media. This month Meta announced a proposed blueprint for federal legislation calling for app stores, not social media companies, to verify users\u2019 ages and enforce an age minimum. Meta also unveiled a slew of new youth safety efforts that included hiding \u201cage-inappropriate content\u201d such as posts discussing self-harm and eating disorders from teens\u2019 Instagram feeds and stories; prompting teens to turn on more restrictive security settings on its apps; a \u201cnighttime nudge\u201d that encourages teen users to stop scrolling on Instagram late at night; and changing teens\u2019 default privacy settings to restrict people they don\u2019t follow or aren\u2019t connected to from sending them direct messages. Snapchat earlier this month also expanded its parental oversight tool, Family Center, to give parents the option to block their teens from interacting with the app\u2019s My AI chatbot and to give parents more visibility into their teens\u2019 safety and privacy settings. Wednesday\u2019s hearing is just the latest instance of tech leaders appearing on Capitol Hill to defend their approach to protecting young users since Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen brought the issue to the forefront of lawmakers\u2019 minds in late 2021. Online safety experts say that some of the new updates, such as restrictions on adult strangers messaging teens, are welcome changes, but that others still put too much pressure on parents to keep their kids safe. Some also say the fact that it has taken platforms years, in some cases, to make relatively basic safety updates is a sign the companies can no longer be trusted to regulate themselves. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken a decade of predators grooming children on Instagram, it shouldn\u2019t have taken massively embarrassing \u2026 lawsuits, it shouldn\u2019t have taken Mark Zuckerberg being hauled before Congress next week,\u201d for Meta and other platforms to make such changes, said Josh Golin, executive director of nonprofit children\u2019s safety group Fairplay. For their part, Meta and other platforms have said they\u2019re aiming to walk a fine line: trying to keep young users safe without too strongly imposing views about what content is or isn\u2019t appropriate for them to view, and instead aiming to empower parents to make those judgment calls. Safety action beyond Congress As efforts to rein in tech platforms have ground to a standstill on Capitol Hill, much of the momentum for regulating social media has picked up outside the halls of Congress. In recent years, Arkansas, Louisiana, Ohio, Utah, and others have passed laws restricting social media for teens, in many cases by establishing a minimum age for social media use or by requiring a tech platform to obtain parental consent before creating accounts for minors. Whether these efforts will prove fruitful may ultimately depend on the courts. Many of these laws are being actively challenged by the tech industry, which has argued that the legislation threatens the First Amendment rights of teens to access lawful information and risks harming Americans\u2019 privacy by forcing tech platforms to collect age information, including potentially biometric data, from a wide range of users including adults. Elsewhere, state-backed and consumer lawsuits against the companies are ramping up pressure to regulate tech platforms as the litigation reveals more about their inner workings. \u201cThe lawsuits serve as a good place to see where a lot of this is happening,\u201d said Zamaan Qureshi, co-chair of the youth-led coalition Design It For Us, a digital safety advocacy group. \u201cWe have all this new information and evidence \u2026 I think the tide has turned, or the temperature has changed.\u201d Lawmakers are as painfully aware as everyone else, Qureshi added, \u201cthat these folks are coming back for their umpteenth hearing.\u201d Spotlight on smaller players Wednesday\u2019s hearing will mark the first opportunity for lawmakers to probe smaller industry players, like X and Discord, about their youth safety efforts. Discord has come under increasing scrutiny due to its role in hosting leaked classified documents, an alleged stock manipulation scheme and the racist and violent messages of a mass shooting suspect. Discord said it has been working to bring lawmakers up to speed about the platform\u2019s basic structure and how it differs from more well-known platforms. Since November, company officials have met with the staff of more than a dozen Judiciary Committee members on both sides of the aisle, Discord said. The hearing will also give lawmakers a chance to personally question X for the first time since its takeover by owner Elon Musk and the platform\u2019s subsequent struggles with hate speech and brand safety. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, X announced plans for a new trust and safety center based in Austin, Texas. \u201cIt is good to have multiple CEOs there because I think Meta gets the overwhelming majority of focus from both Congress and the media, but these are industry-wide problems that demand industry-wide solutions,\u201d Golin said.",

          "raw_content": "The hype over artificial intelligence is starting to fade. One of the sobering realizations was that training such large language models (LLM) bolsters personal data protection concerns. These concerns were already heightened by the increasing data usage in business, which had led to regulations such as the EU\u2019s GDPR and California\u2019s CCPA. Freely using public web data to create AI-based products and services has also raised pressing copyright and data ownership issues, resulting in a number of legal suits filed in 2023. These suits include a copyright infringement case against OpenAI for using 300,000 books to train its model, another lawsuit against Stability AI for using images and metadata owned by Getty, as well as a case against Github\u2019s Copilot for republishing code, among others. Some of the questions raised by those cases might be answered in courts as early as 2024. Lawsuits against AI firms and a web data collection provider should give us a clearer view of those areas. The changes in regulation that such case law and public scrutiny will bring are bound to have an effect on how AI and automated data gathering develop in the future. Some trends and directions are already shaping up. More on Artificial IntelligenceExplore Built In\u2019s AI Coverage What Are the Main Legal and Ethical Questions Facing AI? In terms of web data collection, ongoing legal battles manifest all the main issues at hand. It\u2019s a question of who owns the data. Social media sites will argue that as they allow posting users information, it\u2019s in the interest of the users to have it protected from being collected and sold. Scraping services might answer that data made public is fair game for everyone, and it\u2019s not up to social media giants to restrict access to it but rather for the users themselves to decide whether they allow their data to be gathered and for what purposes. Importantly, the previous argument is limited to the data that is publicly available and accessible without logging into an account, which brings us to the second point. Creating accounts and logging in will mean agreeing to the site\u2019s terms and conditions, which will usually ban bot activity and scraping. Thus, social media companies will argue breach of such accepted terms and conditions, which has been among the main arguments that kept scraping at bay. Once again, there is a question of whether social media platforms are justified in limiting access to the data in this way since they don\u2019t own the data created by users either. Here, user opinions might differ on whether social media sites are protecting their data or appropriating it by limiting public access to it. Finally, there is a special concern regarding the data of minors. This is what a proposed class action lawsuit accuses a data provider in Israel, where selling data of minors is explicitly prohibited. Since the training of LLMs and AI development are dependent on scraped data, AI faces the same legal issues. It\u2019s all about data privacy, ownership and how, if at all, data creators should be compensated for their products being used to train machine learning algorithms that go on to produce something else. More on AIData Privacy Laws Every Company Should Know Will AI Development Halt in 2024? Earlier this year, there was a call from 1,000 tech leaders to pause AI development for at least six months until we can better understand it. What motivated the open letter was the lack of regulation and multiple unknowns related to how AI works and develops. Now, it might seem like their plea is going to be answered to some extent due to the aforementioned legal and ethical concerns. However, it\u2019s highly unlikely that regulation will seriously halt all AI development in the near future. Although legal battles might temporarily delay the evolution of generative AI and tools based on machine learning, in the long run, clear regulation should give direction to the field. This can boost focused progress. Additionally, there are other emerging techniques in the field that might offer much-needed technological breakthroughs. These include federated machine learning and causal AI, which might prove to be a step forward from only superficially intelligent generative systems. Federated learning is a framework that allows training machine learning algorithms without direct access to users\u2019 personal data, solving the pressing issues of data privacy and isolated data islands. Causal AI, on the other hand, offers hope to solve the problem of predictive models hallucinating strange outcomes due to failing to grasp causal relations. Generative AI falls short of objectivity and accuracy because it equates correlation with causation. Causal AI functions more like the human mind, asking such questions as \u201cwhat if\u201d and examining the possible relationships between cause and effect. This could make AI more reliable. This allows the hope for successfully deploying such models in a broad range of use cases, for example, analyzing health data to assist in diagnosing and prevention. And it shows that AI still has a lot of room for development, even as we wait for broadening regulation. Is General Web Scraping Regulation Coming? When faced with the challenges of personal data protection in a highly digitalized society, the EU introduced GDPR as a general framework. After working on it since 2021 and being blindsided by generative AI models in 2022, the EU seems to have agreed on the foundational rules for the first comprehensive AI law as 2023 closes. The law will distinguish between different risk levels of AI models, banning those that are considered unacceptable and requiring transparency from tools like ChatGPT. In the U.S., President Joe Biden released an executive order outlining new standards for AI safety and innovation that could set the policy direction for federal agencies on AI. Does this pave the way for a general web scraping regulation as well? It\u2019s unlikely that we will see it any time soon, much less in 2024. Web scraping has many crucial applications, ranging from making Google and other search engines possible to driving investigative journalism and research across various fields, including AI. It\u2019s more likely that we will see more laws targeting specific illegitimate applications of web scraping infrastructure. For example, there are calls for expanding the BOTS Act that bans using automated solutions for ticketing. Additionally, we might see broader adoption of tools and regulations like the Delete Act of California, going into power with the start of the new year. The act mandates regulators to create a tool allowing consumers to issue a single request to stop all data brokers registered in the state from storing and collecting their data. More on AIHow Web Scraping Is Shaping the Future of Machine Learning How Will These Lawsuits Impact AI in 2024? Some mentioned regulatory changes may have effects within months, while lawsuits might take years to complete and establish mandatory rules, which isn\u2019t even a given. In most cases, we will have to wait and see what exact changes it will bring to the data gathering industry, AI that depends on it, and the users of these services.",

(Strength: 6)\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe competing factors present a complex scenario. On one hand, Ukraine's determination, advanced drone capabilities, and recent successful strikes suggest a high likelihood of an attack on the Crimean Bridge. The strategic importance of the bridge further incentivizes Ukraine to target it. On the other hand, the extensive Russian defenses, previous failed attempts, and potential limitations in Western support present significant challenges.\n\nThe fact that no attack occurred around Putin's May 7 inauguration, despite speculations, indicates that either the opportunity was missed or Russian defenses were effective. However, Ukraine's continued focus on the bridge and recent successful operations in Crimea suggest that they are still actively pursuing this goal.\n\nGiven the balance of these factors, the probability of an attack on the Crimean Bridge before July 1, 2024, seems moderately high but not certain. The presence of strong defenses and the need for increased Western support are significant obstacles, but Ukraine's determination and capabilities cannot be underestimated.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.65</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of previous attacks on the Crimean Bridge and the current geopolitical context. The bridge has been successfully attacked twice in the past two years, suggesting a non-negligible base rate for such events. However, the increased defenses and the complexity of executing a successful attack must be factored in.\n\nThe initial probability of 0.65 seems reasonable given the current information, but it is essential to ensure that this estimate is not overly influenced by recent successful strikes and the stated intentions of Ukrainian officials. The probability should reflect a balanced view of both the capabilities and challenges faced by Ukraine.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the initial probability appears to be a fair assessment, taking into account the various factors and their interactions. The likelihood of an attack on the Crimean Bridge before July 1, 2024, remains moderately high but not certain.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.65*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "They have become a familiar sight in the skies above parts of Russia: long-range enemy drones, buzzing their way to another target. In the biggest Ukrainian onslaught inside Russian territory since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion two years ago, Ukraine has in recent weeks carried out a series of attacks on Russian oil refineries and ports. On Tuesday, it hit a refinery and drone factory in the industrial region of Tatarstan - more than 800 miles from the border. The Ukrainian spy agency behind these drone strikes has its eyes on another target: the 12-mile long Kerch bridge connecting occupied Crimea with Russia. Senior officials from Ukraine\u2019s HUR military intelligence service indicate it is plotting a third attempt on the bridge, after two previous attempts to blow it up, claiming its destruction is \u201cinevitable\u201d. For Putin, the bridge is a tangible reminder of what he sees as one of his greatest political achievements: the peninsula\u2019s 2014 \u201creturn\u201d to Russia using undercover Russian troops and a sham referendum. For Kyiv, the bridge is equally a hated symbol of the Kremlin\u2019s illegal annexation. Its destruction would strengthen Ukraine\u2019s campaign to liberate Crimea and raise morale on and off the battlefield, where Kyiv\u2019s forces are gradually being pushed back. How any Ukrainian attack would unfold is unclear and there are serious doubts about whether the HUR is capable of pulling off a special operation against such a well-defended and obvious target. Russia has taken extensive measures to protect the bridge, strengthening anti-aircraft defences and deploying a \u201ctarget barge\u201d as a decoy for incoming guided missiles. The HUR thinks it can disable the bridge soon. \u201cWe will do it in the first half of 2024,\u201d one official told the Guardian, adding that Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the main directorate of intelligence, already had \u201cmost of the means to carry out this goal\u201d. He was following a plan approved by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to \u201cminimise\u201d Russia\u2019s naval presence in the Black Sea. Over the past five months Ukraine has sunk seven landing boats and large ships belonging to Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The latest, the Sergei Kotov, capsized in March after a night-time raid involving 10 Ukrainian Magura V5 amphibious drones packed with explosives as it was on patrol south of the Kerch bridge. HUR officials indicated this was a \u201cshaping operation\u201d prior to another attack on the crossing. The bridge has been hit and repaired twice before. A 3am raid by Ukrainian sea drones last July caused extensive damage to the road section, which runs parallel to a separate railway section used by Russia\u2019s military to move tanks and supplies. In October 2022 an explosion, Russia said from a bomb smuggled on to a truck, caused several spans of roadway to fall into the water. If the bridge were permanently compromised, Moscow would be forced to transport military supplies by road through occupied southern Ukraine. The route would go via Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, which Russia partly captured in spring 2022. Ukrainian officials believe this would significantly impair the Kremlin\u2019s ability to carry out offensives at a time when its ground forces are advancing. The officials indicated that western weapons would allow Ukraine to destroy the bridge more speedily and Zelenskiy has repeatedly asked Berlin for its long-range Taurus missile system. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has so far refused, arguing that this would be tantamount to his country taking a direct role in the war with Russia, and a dangerous escalation. Pro-Kremlin Russian channels last month released an intercepted phone call in which high-ranking German military officials discussed the capabilities of Taurus. The experts estimated that 10 to 20 missiles would probably be enough to destroy the bridge. Budanov\u2019s deputy, Maj Gen Vadym Skybytskyi, said he believed European politicians were wrong to fear escalation. \u201cWhat does escalation mean for us? We have had two years of war. It\u2019s an everyday procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia bombs our territory. It hits power stations and civilian infrastructure.\u201d He said victory was currently impossible on the battlefield, given Russia\u2019s military superiority and a shortage on the Ukrainian side of artillery shells and fighter jets, and suggested Kyiv had \u201cno choice\u201d but to take the fight to targets deep behind enemy lines, including military infrastructure, command and control centres and industrial production sites that made \u201cweapons and munitions\u201d. Kyiv used a Nato-standard procedure known as centre of gravity or Cog, he added \u2013 a model where outsized results can be achieved by selecting and then eliminating a few carefully picked high-value targets. In recent months the HUR has sought to wipe out Russia\u2019s refining capacity. Its long-range drones have hit Russian oil terminals in Putin\u2019s home city of St Petersburg, more than 1,000km (621 miles) from Ukraine\u2019s border. There have been attacks in the Oryol region, a blast on a train in the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil, and a strike in the Baltic port of Ust-Luga. The Tuapse oil refinery on the Black Sea also caught fire. The Financial Times reported that Washington had urged Kyiv to halt drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure for fear of driving up global oil prices. During Russia\u2019s elections last month there were explosions at fuel facilities in the Oryol and Nizhny Novgorod regions, and in the border region of Belgorod, where pro-Ukrainian Russian fighters using armoured vehicles carried out several separate border incursions. One drone was shot down near Moscow, its mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Ukraine planned to strike more Russian targets, Skybytskyi claimed, with undercover agents playing a part. Some were \u201cRussians with Ukrainian roots\u201d; others were non-ideological Russians recruited in exchange for payments. The \u201cpool\u201d was so large the HUR could pick and choose candidates for sabotage operations, he said. But Russia\u2019s own spy agencies were now back after a period on the back foot, the general added. They had adapted their techniques, he suggested. After Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion, western governments, including the UK, expelled large numbers of career Russian intelligence officers stationed abroad under diplomatic cover. There was apparent proof of the Kremlin\u2019s renewed confidence in February when a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine was found murdered in a Spanish seaside resort. Brigadier-general Dmytro Timkov, the HUR\u2019s top security official, said Maksim Kuzminov had been warned not to leave Ukraine for the EU. He ignored the advice, Timkov said. Timkov compared Ukraine to a patient on life support, in desperate need of further assistance. \u201cWe are attached to a drip. We have enough drugs to stay alive. But if the west wants us to win we need the full treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we fall down.\u201d",

Ukraine has made it a mission to try and destroy the bridges connecting Russian supply chains to Crimea, which continues to serve as a major operational hub for Russia as it perpetuates its invasion, East2West News reported. Additionally, the Ukrainian Navy has made surprising and significant gains against its Russian counterpart, pushing back the Black Sea Fleet from more valuable coastal positions. UKRAINE ALLEGES RUSSIA INCREASINGLY USING TEAR GAS ILLEGALLY IN BATTLE \"In the ranks of the service, we have raised unique specialists in naval drones in order to further improve and scale up the work of clearing the Black Sea from the enemy,\" SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk said earlier. SBU used the drones to take out four enemy warships in Sevastopol Bay and at least half a dozen other vessels in subsequent missions, including a new Russian reconnaissance ship, Interfax-Ukraine reported. Ukraine has relied on the \"Sea Baby\" drone as its key tool to achieve these various goals: A specially developed version loaded with nearly a full ton of explosives made a run at the Crimean Bridge and caused structural damage. Despite that hit, and damage from a bomb smuggled onto the bridge in a truck, Russia has continued to use the bridge. JOHNSON LIKELY FORCED TO GET DEM HELP ON FOREIGN AID PLAN AS REPUBLICANS DECRY LACK OF BORDER MEASURES Now, Ukraine has made the destruction of the bridge a top priority. The use of the drones also helps another issue the Ukrainian military has struggled with over the past year: Disproportionate funding that threatens to tip the advantage towards Russia. The Mamai\u2019s high speeds, mixed with the variable utility of the Sea Baby, have only increased Ukraine\u2019s reliance on drones as the main tool of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. Dekhtiarenko noted the cost of a drone at just shy of a quarter-million dollars, which has the ability to hit and damage warships worth \"tens of millions of dollars.\" Made of material that is invisible to radar, according to Ukrainian outlet Pravda, the drones help to even out the cost-benefit imbalance of the war. RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE THREATENS GLOBAL SECURITY, GERMAN CHANCELLOR SAYS Ukraine also employs a \"fast\" kamikaze surface drone called the Cossack Mamai, which can hit 62 miles per hour, according to Ukrainian outlet EuroMaiden Press.

          "raw_content": "Powerful explosions hit the main base of Russian military aviation in Crimea in the early hours of Wednesday and set fires burning for hours, in long-range strikes the Kremlin said were American ATACMS missiles fired by Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) gunners. Local social media followed by regional officials reported more than twenty explosions of varying intensity audible in the vicinity of Belbek airfield beginning shortly before 2 a.m. Moscow time and lasting about ten minutes. Russian officials in the occupation authority in the Kremlin-occupied Crimea in early statements said Ukrainian forces had launched long-range missiles at Belbek airfield but all the Ukrainian weapons were shot down. Later official announcements, among them by the Moscow-appointed \u201cmayor\u201d of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev, said US-manufactured ATACMS missiles had been used in the alleged failed strikes. The Russian officials claimed all the ATACMS were intercepted by Russian air defenses, but some of the US-made precision-guided weapons had dispersed cluster munitions, prompting the authorities to warn the public not to touch them. Independent analysts and local social media contradicted the Kremlin narrative that a major Ukrainian missile strike against Belbek caused no damage. Comments in Sevastopol and Crimean military chat groups confirmed the launch of air defense missiles but, also, multiple explosions on the ground within the confines of the airfield. Prior to Russia\u2019s second invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 the Russian Air Force usually based between 20-40 combat fighters and bombers at Belbek full time. Independent analysts said recordings of major fires burning at the airfield for at least two hours following the strikes, and secondary explosions unconfirmed but reported widely by local residents as the fires burned, could possibly be evidence that the target of the Ukrainian missile strikes were not aircraft, but Belbek airfield\u2019s ammunition bunkers and fuel depots. According to unconfirmed reports, a second wave of missiles entered the airspace over Belbek and attacked ground targets at 02:35 a.m. In past major missile attacks against the Russian military, Ukrainian air strike planners frequently have staggered weapon launches and routed missiles to targets from multiple directions. The pro-Ukraine Crimea-focused military monitoring group Krymsky Veter in posts over Wednesday morning said that locals reported massive fires burning at the airfield until near sunrise, with red flames lighting up the horizon. The blaze(s) intensified following the second round of strikes, that source claimed. Review of imagery from at least two civilian satellite passes over the airfield following the strikes showed three major fires burning in the airfield\u2019s service area south of the main runway, where air unit administrative buildings, aviation fuel depots and bomb bunkers are visible, the independent Russian news platform reported. The fires by morning had been burning for at least three hours, that source said. The military analysis platform OSINTechnical wrote: \u201cBased on the FIRMS data, Ukraine conducted a successful ATACMS strike overnight on Russia\u2019s Belbek Airbase. Multiple [satellite] passes show a massive fire encompassing the southern flightline, likely fed by burning fuel or munitions.\u201d FIRMS, or Fire Information for Research Management System, is a NASA-administered worldwide satellite data-gathering project that identifies and tracks the progress of major fires worldwide. A Kyiv Post check of the OSINTechnical claim found fire imagery near Belbek, possibly at three locations. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry in a Wednesday morning statement acknowledged the fact of the Ukrainian attack but repeated claims all incoming missiles \u2013 purportedly ten in total \u2013 were shot down and asserted neither ground installations nor personnel were hit. There was no damage save a minor fire in a field sparked by falling missile debris near the village of Polushko, Crimean authorities claimed. There was no direct official Ukrainian response. However, in mid-morning, following those Moscow declarations of success, the semi-official Telegram channel Operativny ZSU (Operational Armed Force of Ukraine) published a video seemingly recorded by a military drone patrolling air space near Belbek airfield at night, and the impact of at least six incoming missiles, all of which detonate on the ground. Beyond identifying the recording as probably collected by a military drone monitoring missile strikes on an inhabited location with low mountains in the background, Kyiv Post could not confirm the video\u2019s authenticity.",

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin asserted that the structure's supporting pylons had not been damaged and that the bridge would be completely repaired by November 1. Nonetheless, the attack struck a key logistical route supplying Russian military forces not only on the Crimean Peninsula but across southern Ukraine, where Kyiv is carrying out a counteroffensive to claw back territory that Russia has occupied since the first weeks of its unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. \u201cThe Crimea Bridge is the main logistical link,\u201d said Pavlo Lakiychuk, a military analyst at the Kyiv-based think tank Strategy XXI. \u201cEven if the railroad bridge was, say, closed for six hours or so and shipping traffic was shut down for a similar period of time, that is a six-hour break for our troops who will have fewer shells raining down on them. That is a plus.\u201d Lakiychuk dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim on July 17 that the bridge \u201chas long not been used\u201d for military transport. \u201cThe bridge has been and remains one of the main supply arteries for supplying Russian forces across southern Ukraine, including in Crimea,\u201d he said. \u201cIncluding those who are defending themselves from the attacks of our forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.\u201d The bridge, he said, is used to supply heavy equipment, ammunition such as artillery shells, fuel, and other crucial, ongoing needs of Russian forces in Ukraine. \u201cDelaying [these supplies] for an hour or two or three or six or 12 is a vital matter for our troops, who are engaged in heavy fighting,\u201d Lakiychuk said. \u201cThe river of military supplies for Russia has slowed to a trickle,\u201d he concluded. Andriy Yusov, the spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR), offered a similar assessment on July 17, saying: \u201cAny logistical problems are one more complication for the occupiers that creates a potential advantage for Ukrainian defense forces.\u201d Khusnullin, the Russian deputy prime minister who was put in charge of the repair works, wrote on Telegram early on July 18 that one lane of the bridge had been reopened for vehicle traffic. Immediate Impact The damage to the bridge also had an immediate impact for civilians in Crimea. Supplies of food and other essentials via the bridge were halted at least temporarily, and Russian occupation authorities warned that it could be days before truck traffic is restored. Trucks were being diverted to ferries, which can be unpredictable due to frequent high winds on the strait. This month, before the attack, truckers were already reporting that inspections and the ferry transit took around three hours. When explosions were heard in the city of Kerch at the Crimea end of the bridge on July 9, de facto officials had to quickly calm people by reporting that the bridge was not targeted. \u201cPeople in Crimea are right to worry about the Kerch bridge because transit through Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory is not safe,\u201d Lakiychuk said. The news outlet Kerch.fm reported in June that truck drivers were refusing to travel between Russia and Crimea via the occupied parts of southern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov coast out of safety concerns and were insisting on higher pay for coping with the delays at the ferries. \u201cBecause of the hours-long waits in line for the ferry, they are demanding \u2018waiting fees,\u2019\u201d the website quoted an employee at a Crimean butcher shop as saying. \u201cDrivers either do not want to go to Crimea or they are charging double to do so.\u201d Increasingly, Crimea resembles a war zone, and the peninsula has been targeted by a mounting number of drone and other attacks in 2023. The occupation authorities have undertaken a massive program of building trenches and other fortifications. However, Ukrainian military analyst Mykhaylo Prytula, a retired army colonel, told RFE/RL that Kyiv\u2019s strategy is to isolate the peninsula as much as possible. \u201cAt some point, Crimea will simply be an island without any connection to the mainland or via the Kerch bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a Crimea without water. Without military supplies\u2026. All that will be working will be the airports and the ports. Car traffic will be closed, and people will not be able to evacuate their possessions.\u201d \u201cAt that point, the only choice will be to surrender or to flee,\u201d Prytula said. The 19-kilometer Crimea Bridge, which facilitates both automotive and rail traffic, was completed in May 2018 at a cost of some $4 billion. It was a significant prestige project intended to bolster Moscow\u2019s claim to Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region that was inaugurated by Putin in person. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast -- the second attack to do substantial damage to the bridge in 10 months -- but Ukrainian media reported that security services had deployed two maritime drones to carry out the operation. Lakiychuk said that could signal a significant technological breakthrough for Kyiv. Ukraine, he said, only began developing sea-based drones after Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion and the work has been carried out \u201cunder wartime conditions.\u201d \u201cIf this is so, the Russian side wasn\u2019t ready for the Ukrainian military\u2019s capability of using such drones so far away from its military bases,\u201d he said. Crimea Becoming A Frontline Zone? He added that such operations generate valuable information for Ukrainian intelligence services that makes future operations more likely to succeed. \u201cIntelligence will have a lot of work now,\u201d Laviychuk said. The July 17 blast followed a major explosion and fire in October 2022 that prevented the full operation of the bridge for months. Lakiychuk said the fact that bridge spans collapsed in both cases could indicate that the foundation of the structure has vulnerabilities. \u201cIf the spans are falling, that means that the supports beneath them are shifting,\u201d he said. The explosion, which Russia said killed a married couple in a car and injured their 14-year-old daughter, will likely reinforce the growing impression that Crimea is a \u201cfrontline zone,\u201d to use the formulation of Refat Chubarov, the Kyiv-based president of the Worldwide Congress of Crimean Tatars and chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, a self-governing body that Russia declared illegal after occupying the peninsula in 2014. After the October 2022 explosion on the bridge, Russia was forced to intensify security checks and other measures for traffic moving in both directions, Chubarov told RFE/RL on June 30, before the most recent blast, causing alarm and frustration for travelers. \u201cThese measures will continue as long as the bridge stands, until it is destroyed by Ukrainian rockets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that will happen soon.\u201d Written by RFE/RL\u2019s Robert Coalson based on reporting by RFE/RL\u2019s Crimea.Realities, RFE/RL\u2019s Russian Service, and Current Time.",

      "1. **Core Factual Points:**\n\n<facts>\n- The Philippines' national security advisor, Eduardo Ano, has called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats over a leaked telephone transcript.\n- The transcript involved a Philippine admiral informally agreeing to terms with Chinese officials regarding the resupply of Philippine Navy personnel in disputed areas.\n- China and the Philippines have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, leading to increased tensions.\n- China has used aggressive tactics, including water cannons, collisions, and military-grade lasers, to hinder the Philippines' resupply efforts.\n- The Philippines has summoned Chinese diplomats and lodged multiple protests against China's actions in the South China Sea.\n- The Chinese foreign ministry has urged the Philippines to cease actions it claims infringe on China's rights and warned of strong countermeasures.\n- The Philippines' Justice Secretary has directed an investigation into the illegal activities of foreign diplomats, emphasizing that diplomatic immunity is not absolute.\n- The international tribunal at The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in 2016, but China has not recognized this decision.\n- Diplomatic relations between the two nations are at a low point, with both sides issuing strong statements and warnings.\n</facts>\n\n2. **Reasons Why the Answer Might Be No:**\n\n<no>\n- **Diplomatic Restraint (Strength: 7):** Both countries may prefer to avoid further escalation and maintain diplomatic channels open to manage the conflict.\n- **Economic and Political Costs (Strength: 6):** Expelling or recalling diplomats can have significant economic and political repercussions, which both countries might want to avoid.\n- **International Pressure (Strength: 5):** Other countries, especially those with interests in the region, may pressure both nations to resolve the issue diplomatically.\n- **Previous Incidents (Strength: 4):** Despite past tensions and confrontations, neither country has resorted to expelling or recalling diplomats, indicating a possible preference for maintaining diplomatic presence.\n</no>\n\n3. **Reasons Why the Answer Might Be Yes:**\n\n<yes>\n- **High Tensions (Strength: 8):** The current situation is highly volatile, with both sides issuing strong statements and warnings, increasing the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls.\n- **National Security Concerns (Strength: 7):** The Philippines may feel compelled to act on national security grounds, especially given the alleged wiretapping and disinformation.\n- **Domestic Political Pressure (Strength: 6):** Both governments may face domestic pressure to take a strong stance, leading to diplomatic expulsions or recalls.\n- **Precedent of Aggressive Actions (Strength: 5):** The aggressive tactics used by China in the South China Sea may push the Philippines to take a more assertive diplomatic stance.\n</yes>\n\n4. **Aggregated Considerations:**\n\n<thinking>\nThe situation between the Philippines and China is highly tense, with significant provocations and aggressive actions from both sides. The call for expulsion of Chinese diplomats by the Philippines' national security advisor and the subsequent strong reactions from China indicate a high level of diplomatic strain. However, both countries have significant reasons to avoid further escalation, including economic and political costs, and the potential for international pressure to de-escalate the situation.\n\nThe historical context shows that despite numerous confrontations, neither country has previously resorted to expelling or recalling diplomats, suggesting a preference for maintaining diplomatic channels. However, the current situation appears more volatile than past incidents, with explicit calls for expulsion and investigations into illegal activities by diplomats.\n\nBalancing these factors, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring before June 1, 2024, is moderately high but not certain. The high tensions and national security concerns weigh heavily towards a \"yes,\" but the potential for diplomatic restraint and the significant costs associated with such actions provide a counterbalance.\n</thinking>\n\n5. **Initial Probability:**\n\n<tentative>0.65</tentative>\n\n6. **Reflection and Sanity Checks:**\n\n<thinking>\nGiven the high tensions and explicit calls for expulsion, a probability of 0.65 seems reasonable. However, considering the historical context where neither country has previously expelled or recalled diplomats despite numerous confrontations, there might be a slight overestimation. The base rate for such diplomatic actions in similar conflicts is relatively low, suggesting a need to adjust the probability slightly downward.\n\nAdditionally, the potential for international pressure and the significant economic and political costs associated with expelling or recalling diplomats should not be underestimated. These factors could lead both countries to seek alternative diplomatic solutions.\n\nAfter reflecting on these considerations, a more conservative estimate would be appropriate.\n</thinking>\n\n7. **Final Prediction:**\n\n<answer>*0.55*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "In the latest escalation in tensions, the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday urged the Philippines to \u201cstop infringing on China\u2019s right and provoking China\u201d. This came a few hours after Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano echoed a call on Wednesday from Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro for the Philippine foreign ministry to \u201ctake appropriate actions against individuals in the Chinese embassy \u2026 for violating Philippine law, particularly the Anti-Wire Tapping Act as well as for serious breaches of diplomatic protocols and conventions\u201d. In a statement on Friday, Ano accused the Chinese embassy in Manila of \u201crepeated acts of engaging and dissemination of disinformation, misinformation and malinformation\u201d, and called for the Chinese diplomats responsible to be expelled. On Tuesday the Chinese embassy in Manila reportedly released to selected media outlets a transcript of the purported phone call between a Chinese diplomat and a Philippine navy officer, prompting the accusations of wiretapping from outraged Philippine officials. \u201cTranscripts can easily be fabricated, and audio recordings can be manufactured by using deep fakes. These reports only aim to serve as a distraction from the China Coast Guard\u2019s ongoing aggressive behaviour,\u201d Brawner said. In Beijing on Friday, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Ano\u2019s statement \u201cprecisely proved\u201d that the Philippine side had \u201cbecome weak in the face of facts and evidence\u201d. \u201cChina solemnly demands that the Philippine side ensure the normal performance of duties by Chinese diplomatic personnel, stop infringing on China\u2019s right and provoking China, and refrain from denying the facts or acting rashly,\u201d he added. Hu Bo, director of Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, said bilateral diplomatic ties had sunk to \u201cthe worst level\u201d in recent decades. \u201cEven at the time of the arbitration case [at The Hague], the Benigno Aquino III administration didn\u2019t deny the agreement over the Second Thomas Shoal,\u201d Hu said. He was referring to an arbitration case filed by Manila in 2013 to challenge Beijing\u2019s claims to almost the whole of the South China Sea under what it calls its historic \u201cnine-dash line\u201d. According to a 2013 report by the news portal Inquirer.net, then Philippine defence secretary Voltaire Gazmin had told then Chinese ambassador Ma Keqing that the Philippines would \u201cnot violate the agreement not to construct new structures\u201d on the Second Thomas Shoal, after Beijing raised its concerns over Manila\u2019s reported plans to do so. \u201cNow the Philippines\u2019 policy has turned upside down, which is a significant change compared with previous governments,\u201d Hu said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that the two governments are now sticking to their own version with no compromise. \u201cChina has been on defensive but if the Philippines continues to push, I don\u2019t think China will show any mercy.\u201d The international tribunal at The Hague ruled in Manila\u2019s favour in 2016, but Beijing has refused to acknowledge the court decision. Ding Duo, an associate research fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, also said that Beijing would take \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d against the Philippines. To manage disputes at sea, China had also made \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreements\u201d with other rival claimants, including Vietnam and Malaysia, he added. \u201cChina will certainly respond with strong countermeasures regardless whether it is from the perspective of defending the rights of the sea, or from the perspective of domestic public opinion, or even from the perspective of preventing other countries from following the footsteps of the Philippines.\u201d The two countries have had a series of confrontations around the Second Thomas Shoal in recent months, with Manila accusing the Chinese coastguard of blocking resupply missions to a grounded warship that hosts a handful of troops. Water cannons have been used against Philippine ships and China has also been accused of ramming vessels. According to Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, Manila\u2019s \u201cassertive transparency\u201d in publicising these incidents had put Beijing on the back foot. \u201cThere is no way China can back down from anything because of domestic reasons, and there\u2019s no sign that the Philippines is abandoning the current strategy Manila believes is quite effective.\u201d Koh said even if Manila was able to identify who had made the recording, \u201cthere would be growing pressure on the Philippine government to expel people within the Chinese embassy \u2026 and that is going to cause more issues between the two countries.\u201d",

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called in China\u2019s deputy chief of mission Zhou Zhiyong on Thursday, two days after the incident at a disputed shoal that left a Philippine coastguard vessel and another government boat damaged. It was the 20th protest by the Philippines against the conduct of China\u2019s coastguard and fishing vessels this year, the ministry said. It has made 153 complaints over the past two years. \u201cThe Philippines protested the harassment, ramming, swarming, shadowing and blocking, dangerous manoeuvres, use of water cannons, and other aggressive actions of [the] China Coast Guard and Chinese maritime militia,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. China seized Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines in 2012 after a months-long standoff. The Philippines said the pressure in Tuesday\u2019s water cannon incident was far more powerful than anything previously used, and that it tore or bent metal sections and equipment on the Philippine vessels. Tensions have escalated over the Scarborough Shoal recently as the Philippines takes a more assertive approach in disputed areas while strengthening alliances with the United States and Japan. A traditional fishing ground used by several countries and close to major shipping lanes, the shoal lies about 220km (137 miles) off the coast of the Philippines and within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an EEZ extends some 200 nautical miles (about 370km) from a country\u2019s coast. The triangular grouping of reefs and rocks is nearly 900 kilometres (559 miles) from the island of Hainan, the nearest major Chinese land mass. China\u2019s embassy in Manila claimed on Wednesday Scarborough Shoal had always been China\u2019s territory and urged the Philippines to cease infringements and provocations and not \u201cchallenge China\u2019s resolve to defend our sovereignty\u201d. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims from other countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertions have no legal basis. Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam also claim the parts of the sea around their coasts.",

Remulla said diplomatic immunity is \u201cnever absolute\u201d and it is the duty of foreign diplomats to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state. \u201cDiplomatic immunity should never be used as a license to exploit our country\u2019s peace and harmony for selfish motives, this privilege does not shield anyone from the consequences of the Rule of Law,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. The Chinese Embassy in Manila allegedly leaked a transcript of a supposed phone call between a Filipino military official and one of its diplomats regarding a \u201cnew model\u201d agreement on the Ayungin Shoal. Citing the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the DOJ said that diplomats, employees of international organizations, and their immediate family members are covered by a certain degree of diplomatic immunity during their stay. \u201cHowever, diplomatic immunity is only with respect to official acts performed in the exercise of official duties and functions necessary for advocating international comity, policies and interests,\u201d it said. GMA News Online has requested comment from the Chinese Embassy in Manila regarding Remulla's statement, but has yet to respond as of posting time. 'Ludicrous, preposterous' National Security Adviser Secretary Eduardo A\u00f1o previously said that China\u2019s claim was \u201cabsolutely absurd, ludicrous, and preposterous.\u201d The Department of Foreign Affairs has also said it will investigate the involvement of foreign diplomats in illegal activities and vowed to take the \"necessary action.\" For his part, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. had also said that those responsible in recording the alleged conversation be should be expelled from the Philippines. A\u00f1o promptly expressed support for Teodoro's call, saying that those behind the recording committed serious breaches of diplomatic protocols and conventions, and violated the Anti-Wiretapping Act. \"Those individuals in the Chinese Embassy responsible for violating Philippine laws and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and those responsible for these malign influence and interference operations must be removed from the country immediately,\" A\u00f1o said. China's diplomats Beijing has strongly criticized the two Philippine officials for their statements, warning that \"any hasty action\" could \"potentially harm\" ties with Manila. China has also said their diplomats should be allowed to freely do their jobs in the country. \u201cChina solemnly demands that the Philippines ensures that Chinese diplomats can perform their duties, stops infringement and provocation and does not deny the facts, act indiscreetly or hurt itself by its own actions,\" China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. Quoting a source in the Chinese Embassy, two major Manila newspapers previously reported about a phone recording in January 2024 between the Chinese side and a Philippine military official, said to be the chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Western Command (AFP WESCOM). Vice Admiral Alberto Carlos was chief of the AFP WESCOM at that time. A transcript of the conversation was reportedly also provided. Leave of absence In the wake of the development, Carlos has taken a leave of absence due to personal reasons, AFP spokesperson Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla said. Padilla, however, was quick to deny that Carlos' leave was linked to the controversy, saying that the timing was \"coincidental.\" China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions, such as harassment of Filipino coast guard vessels and fishermen, in Philippine territories have angered Manila. China has repeatedly assaulted the Philippine Coast Guard and supply boats with water cannons, military grade lasers and dangerous blockings in high seas, causing damage and injuries. A vital trading and shipping lane, the South China Sea, dotted with rocks, shoals and reefs where rich oil and mineral deposits were found, are claimed in part or in whole by the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. Parts of the waters within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone have been renamed West Philippine Sea.",

This event is co-organized by the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego\u2019s School of Global Policy and Strategy, as part of its annual China Forum. FROMAN: Good evening. My name is Mike Froman. I\u2019m president of the Council on Foreign Relations. And it is a distinct honor to welcome you here tonight for the opening of a very important two-day meeting on U.S.-China relations organized by the UC San Diego Forum on U.S.-China Relations, which has become no doubt the premier forum of experts from around the country on China and its relationship with the United States. And thanks for the foresight and the leadership of Susan Shirk\u2014who, by the way, last night in New York was awarded the Arthur Ross Medal for her book\u2014Kurt Campbell, Steve Hadley, Charlene Barshefsky, the forum has really become the go-to event for experts on China. We\u2019re delighted to cosponsor tonight\u2019s event. And we\u2019re delighted in particular to welcome back to the Council National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake joins us tonight after twelve hours of back-to-back negotiations with Wang Yi at Central Foreign Affairs Commission in Bangkok this past weekend. These are the first high-level talks since the Biden-Xi summit in November and perhaps some of the most important conversations that have been had around some of the biggest issues, including defusing tension around Taiwan. And this is on top of managing U.S. policy toward two wars and the strike on U.S. soldiers in Jordan\u2014or, in other words, just another weekend for Jake. (Laughter.) To what can we attribute Jake\u2019s work ethic, his unflappable nature, his remarkable record of success? Clearly, it must have been his internship at the Council on Foreign Relations\u2014(laughter)\u2014where he worked at the right hand of one of my predecessors, Les Gelb. We\u2019re proud to call him a part of the CFR family, even when he calls for an end to seventy-five years of U.S. international economic policy that has been the hallmark of the Council. (Laughter.) Back in 2019, Jake wrote a piece with Kurt Campbell for a little magazine called Foreign Affairs. He warned against trying to transform China, and instead called for the U.S. to establish, quote, \u201cfavorable terms of coexistence\u201d with Beijing across military, economic, and political issues. And we see those ideas enshrined in U.S. policy\u2014cooperating where we can, managing conflict where we must, and competing where we should. And that approach has paid dividends: mil-to-mil communications have resumed, cooperation on fentanyl, progress on climate, momentum for COP-28, and discussions of artificial intelligence. Jake, Kurt, and their teams have done a remarkable job of consolidating the U.S. approach to China under a clear, united, and intellectually rigorous framework, and now that bilateral relations have stabilized there\u2019s an opportunity to step back and ask some tough questions. For starters, there\u2019s a feverish consensus of\u2014on the nature of the China challenge but less clarity on where we\u2019re heading with the relationship. As Jake warned in that 2019 article, a failure to connect competitive means to clear ends will allow U.S. policy to drift towards competition for competition\u2019s sake and then fall into a dangerous cycle of confrontation. Jake, clearly, should be careful what he writes for Foreign Affairs. (Laughter.) What are the clear ends that we\u2019re trying to achieve? To what degree does China now buy into our cooperation-conflict management-competition paradigm and what is the new equilibrium we seek to establish with China? These are some of the big questions that are being looked at including here at the Council and we welcome all of your participation in that work, going forward, that is, if Jake doesn\u2019t provide the definitive answers tonight. And who better to elicit those answers than Steve Hadley, one of the leaders of the U.S.-China Forum, a member of CFR\u2019s board of directors, and one of Jake\u2019s predecessors as national security adviser who has spent much of his life wrestling with these and other difficult questions? I very much look forward to the conversation. But, first, let me invite Jake Sullivan to the podium to share his thoughts. (Applause.) SULLIVAN: At least I had the bravery to give that speech at Brookings rather than at CFR. (Laughter.) So, Mike, I want to say thank you for having me back at CFR, and to Susan and Kurt and Charlene and Steve, thank you for having me back at the UCSD China Forum which I\u2019ve had the privilege of actually attending since its inauguration. I would say San Diego in January is a little nicer than D.C. in January but we\u2019ll make do here. My aim today is not to try to unveil a new China strategy but something more straightforward, to share with you behind the curtain how we\u2019ve tried to implement our strategy over the last three years and then what we might expect here in 2024, and in the course of that without directly answering the questions Mike has posed perhaps provide a little grist for the mill that can help over the next couple of days as you grapple with these very difficult questions. I want to start by taking a step back. Before serving in the Biden administration many of us who are now in government, including myself and Kurt and others, we\u2019re revisiting the assumptions behind our long-standing China policy in writing and in conferences like this one, and once in government we immersed ourselves in the latest intelligence, expertise, and analysis. We determined that the PRC was the only state with both the intent to reshape the international order and the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. We saw that the PRC sought to, quote, \u201ccatch up and surpass\u201d the United States in high technology, that it was pursuing the largest peacetime military buildup in history, and that it was more repressive at home and more assertive abroad including in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait. We saw the PRC working to make the world more dependent on China while reducing its own dependence on the world and we saw it taking steps to adapt the international system to accommodate its own system and preferences. We also saw something that really stood out, which is that the PRC believed the United States was in terminal decline, that our industrial base had been hollowed out, that our commitment to our allies and partners had been undercut, that the United States was struggling to manage a once in a century pandemic, and that many in Beijing were openly proclaiming that, quote, \u201cthe East was rising and the West was falling.\u201d When we came into office we inherited an approach from the previous administration that had updated the diagnosis of the scope and nature of the China challenge but did not adequately develop the strategy and tools to address it. That approach was at times more confrontational than competitive and too often undervalued the allies and partners critical to sustaining an effective China strategy. Well, we did not want to return to an earlier approach with the PRC, one based on more optimistic assumptions about its trajectory and that sometimes prioritized avoiding friction over pursuing the American national interest. So we\u2019ve developed our own approach, which Secretary Blinken laid out in a speech a couple of years ago\u2014invest, align, compete\u2014that sought to strengthen our competitive position and secure our interests and values, while carefully managing this vital relationship. And over the past three years, we\u2019ve implemented that approach. We\u2019ve made far-reaching investments in the Foundation of American Strength at Home, with historic legislation on infrastructure, chips and science, and clean energy, all while addressing the PRC\u2019s non-market practices, and taking steps to ensure that the United States would lead in the sources of technological and economic growth. We believe our approach has generated results. Large-scale investments in semiconductor and clean energy production in the United States are up twenty-fold since 2019. Construction spending on new manufacturing projects has already doubled. And looking out over the next decade, we\u2019re estimating $3.5 trillion in new public and private investment, unlocked by the investments made in the\u2014in the historic legislation I just referenced. Abroad, we\u2019ve tried to strengthen our ties with Indo-Pacific allies and partners in ways that would have been unlikely, even inconceivable, a few years ago. We launched AUKUS. We elevated the Quad. We upgrade our relationship with Vietnam and the Philippines, India, Indonesia, and others. We launched a historic trilateral with Japan and the Republic of Korea, that culminated in a historic summit that President Biden hosted at Camp David. We held summits, multiple summits, with the leaders of the Pacific Islands, as well as with ASEAN. Our regional allies and partners, for their part, are betting on American economic vitality. They\u2019ve announced almost $200 billion of investments into the United States since the start of the administration. We\u2019ve also worked to connect our European and Indo-Pacific alliances, and together with our G-7 partners, we\u2019ve aligned on collective steps to de-risk our economies, and diversify away from strategic dependencies, rather than decoupling. And alongside our allies and partners, we\u2019ve stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We\u2019ve also worked hard to ensure that advanced and sensitive technologies our companies are developing do not become a source of vulnerability. We implemented carefully tailored export restrictions on key technologies, focused on advanced semiconductor manufacturing tools\u2014a topic, by the way, that was central to one of the earlier UCSD forums, when I first really got immersed in this question of semiconductor manufacturing equipment\u2014supercomputing capabilities, and the most advanced chips, critical to military modernization. We also took steps to regulate outbound investments of concern in technology, and to strengthen CFIUS\u2019 focus on critical technologies, to make sure inbound investment actually addresses evolving national security challenges\u2014the screening regime for inbound investment. These steps are not about protectionism, and they\u2019re not about holding anybody back. They are critical for our national security over the long run. Now, the backdrop to these actions was the strongest post-pandemic recovery, and among the lowest inflation of any leading economy in the world. For years, economists were predicting that the PRC would overtake the United States in GDP either in this decade, or the next. Now, those projections are moving further and further out. And with the PRC facing its own set of challenges, some say that moment may never come. And this brings me to a critical point: America, in this moment, is once more showing its capacity for resilience and reinvention. But this is not the whole story, and that's what\u2019s really critical about the remarks I want to give today. As we took these steps to improve our competitive position, we aim to do so in a way that builds stability into one of the world\u2019s most consequential relationships, perhaps the world\u2019s most consequential relationship. And in fact, we believe our investments at home, and our work to deepen ties with allies and partners abroad, actually created the conditions for more effective diplomacy with the PRC. A sustainable China policy is about holding in one\u2019s head multiple truths at the same time, and working iteratively to reconcile them. We are clear-eyed about the competitive structural dynamics in our relationship with the PRC. But we are also keenly aware that the United States and the PRC are economically interdependent, and share interests in addressing transnational problems, and reducing the risk of conflict. We realize that efforts\u2014implied or explicit\u2014to shape or change the PRC over several decades did not succeed. We expect that the PRC will be a major player on the world stage for the foreseeable future. That means that even as we compete, we have to find ways to live alongside one another. Competition with the PRC does not have to lead to conflict, confrontation, or a new Cold War. The United States can take steps to advance its interests and values and those of its allies and partners, on the one hand, while responsibly managing competition on the other. Being able to do both of those things is at the heart of our approach. And, in fact, the United",

          "raw_content": "A flotilla of about 100 mostly small fishing boats led by Filipino activists has set sail for a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, where Beijing\u2019s coast guard and suspected militia ships have used powerful water cannon to ward off what they regard as intruders. The Philippine coast guard and navy deployed one patrol ship each to keep watch from a distance on the activists and fishers, who set off on wooden boats with bamboo outriggers on Wednesday to assert Manila\u2019s sovereignty over the Scarborough shoal. Dozens of journalists joined the three-day voyage. Activists and volunteers, including a Roman Catholic priest, belonging to a non-government coalition called Atin Ito \u2013 Tagalog for This is Ours \u2013 planned to float small territorial buoys and distribute food packs and fuel to Filipino fishers near the shoal, organisers said, adding they were prepared for contingencies. \u201cOur mission is peaceful based on international law and aimed at asserting our sovereign rights,\u201d said Rafaela David, a lead organiser. \u201cWe will sail with determination, not provocation, to civilianise the region and safeguard our territorial integrity.\u201d In December, David\u2019s group also tried to sail to another disputed shoal but cut short the trip after being tailed by a Chinese ship. China effectively seized the Scarborough Shoal, a triangle-shaped atoll with a vast fishing lagoon ringed by mostly submerged coral outcrops, by surrounding it with its coast guard ships after a tense 2012 standoff with Philippine government ships. Angered by China\u2019s action, the Philippine government brought the disputes to international arbitration in 2013 and largely won with a tribunal in The Hague ruling three years later that China\u2019s expansive claims based on historical grounds in the busy seaway were invalid under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The ruling declared the Scarborough Shoal a traditional fishing area for Chinese, Filipino and Vietnamese fishers. In the past, fishers have anchored in the shoal to avoid huge waves in the high seas in stormy weather. China refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected the outcome and continues to defy it. Two weeks ago, Chinese coast guard and suspected militia ships used water cannon on Philippine coast guard and fisheries boats patrolling the Scarborough Shoal, damaging both craft. The Philippines condemned the Chinese coast guard\u2019s action on the shoal, which lies in the south-east Asian nation\u2019s internationally recognised exclusive economic zone. The Chinese coast guard said it took a \u201cnecessary measure\u201d after the Philippine ships \u201cviolated China\u2019s sovereignty\u201d. The Chinese coast guard has also reinstalled a floating barrier across the entrance to the shoal\u2019s vast fishing lagoon, the Philippine coast guard said. The Philippine coast guard removed a similar barrier in the past to allow Filipinos to fish there. In addition to the Philippines and China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the territorial disputes. Chinese coast guard ships had also ventured into waters close to Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia in the past, sparking tensions and protests, but those nations with considerable economic ties with China have not been as aggressively critical of Beijing\u2019s increasingly assertive actions. The Philippines has released videos of its territorial face-offs with China and invited journalists to witness the hostilities in the high seas in a strategy to gain international support, sparking a war of words with Beijing.",

          "raw_content": "By Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) -The Philippines' national security adviser called on Friday for Chinese diplomats to be expelled over an alleged leak of a phone conversation with a Filipino admiral in a significant escalation of a bitter row over the South China Sea. China's embassy in Manila had orchestrated \"repeated acts of engaging and dissemination of disinformation, misinformation and malinformation\", with the objective of sowing discord, division and disunity, Eduardo Ano said in a statement. Those actions \"should not be allowed to pass unsanctioned without serious penalty\", he said. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian called the comments provocative and said Chinese diplomats in the Philippines had to be allowed to do their job. \"China solemnly requests the Philippine side to effectively safeguard the normal performance of duties by Chinese diplomatic personnel, stop infringing and provoking, and refrain from denying the facts,\" Lin said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. The office of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The two countries have been embroiled in a series of heated stand-offs this past year in disputed areas of the South China Sea as the Philippines, emboldened by support from the United States and other allies, steps up activities in waters occupied by China's vast coast guard. Asked to comment on the latest row, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said: \"We are aware of the media reports and defer to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs.\" China has accused the Philippines of trespassing and of treachery, while Manila has scolded Beijing for what it says is a policy of aggression and dangerous manoeuvring inside its exclusive economic zone. The expelling of diplomats could intensify a row that has so far seen heated exchanges, diplomatic protests and the ramming and water-cannoning of Philippine ships at two disputed shoals, the closest of which is more than 850 km (530 miles) away from mainland China. Ano was referring to a news report this week of an alleged leak of a call between a Chinese diplomat and a Filipino admiral discussing a dispute over the South China Sea, which carried a transcript that showed the admiral agreeing to concessions with China. According to the transcript published by the Manila Times, the admiral agreed to China's proposal of a \"new model\", where the Philippines would use fewer vessels in resupply trips to marines stationed at a grounded warship at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, and notify Beijing about the missions in advance. Reuters has not heard the reported phone conversation and could not verify the contents of the published transcript. The report said the conversation had taken place in January and the transcript was provided by a \"ranking Chinese official\", which it did not name. 'INTERFERENCE OPERATIONS' Ano said he backed the defence minister's call for the foreign ministry to take appropriate action against embassy officials, who he claimed recorded an alleged phone conversation in violation of Philippine laws, including its anti-wire tapping act, as well as serious breaches of diplomatic protocols. \"Those individuals in the Chinese embassy ... and those responsible for these malign influence and interference operations must be removed from the country immediately,\" he said. On Wednesday, Chinese spokesperson Lin said the embassy in Manila had released details about \"relevant communications\" between the two countries on managing the situation at the Second Thomas Shoal. Lin, in comments shared by the embassy, did not elaborate on what details or communications were released, or when, but said \"facts are clear and backed by hard evidence that cannot be denied\". \"The Philippines has insisted on denying these objective facts and seeks to mislead the international community,\" Lin added. China has long been vexed by the Philippines' maintaining its small military presence aboard the grounded warship Sierre Madre at the Second Thomas Shoal, where it has been since 1999 to try to prop up its territorial claim. Beijing has repeatedly said the Philippines had agreed to tow that ship away, which Manila denies. Manila-based political analyst Julio Amador said expelling diplomats should be part of the Philippines' diplomatic tool kit and Chinese embassy officials had shown they did not value their working relationships with Filipino officials. \"Diplomacy is based on trust, yet China is trying to make it look like all meetings between its diplomats and Philippine government representatives are negotiations with binding results,\" he said. \"It has no right to make demands on the Philippines on how the latter manages areas over which it has sovereign rights.\" (Additional reporting by Joe Cash and David Brunnstrom; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Neil Fullick and Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

    "question": "Will Sir Lindsay Hoyle remain Speaker of the House of Commons until March 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "[Sir Lindsay Hoyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Hoyle) is a former Labour MP and the current speaker of the House of Commons in the UK. Unlike in the US, the speaker of the House of Commons in the UK is not a member of either party and is conventionally strictly non-partisan. \n\nOn the 21st of February 2024, he caused tremendous controversy and uproar amongst members of the Tory and SNP parties when, on the SNP's opposition day (a day where the SNP decides which issues are debated in the House of Commons) he selected the Labour amendment to the SNP's motion to be debated, in addition to the SNPs motion. This was controversial because the Tory government had also put forth an amendment for consideration, and long-standing precedent is that if the government puts forward an amendment, then only that amendment will be considered in addition to the original motion. \n\nMembers of the SNP expressed their fury with the decision, as it undermined their opposition day and as it posed the possibility of the house not being able to vote on the SNPs own motion on its opposition day. The Tory Party was upset because in addition to breaking with convention, the decision put many members of the government in a politically precarious position because it would likely result in the government's own amendment not being considered. As a result, the Tory Party abstained from both votes, and the SNP's motion and the Labour amendments passed unanimously without a division. \n\nIn statements in the House after the motion and amendment had passed, the leader of the SNP and Tory parties both expressed their concern over their parties to have confidence in the speaker's impartiality going forward.",

(Strength: 6)\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n- Hoyle has apologized and explained his intentions, which might mitigate some of the backlash. (Strength: 5)\n- The Clerk of the House noted that Hoyle's actions were not explicitly against parliamentary rules, which could provide a defense for his decision. (Strength: 6)\n- Hoyle has a history of public service and has been Speaker since 2019, which might provide him with some support and stability. (Strength: 5)\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe introduction of a motion of no confidence is a significant factor that could lead to Hoyle's removal. The expressed concerns from both the SNP and Tory parties add to the pressure on Hoyle. However, his apology and the fact that his actions were not explicitly against parliamentary rules might mitigate some of the backlash. Additionally, his history of public service and tenure as Speaker could provide him with some support.\n\nThe key factors to consider are the likelihood of the no-confidence motion passing and the extent to which Hoyle's apology and explanation will be accepted by the MPs. Given the severity of the controversy and the strong reactions from the SNP and Tory parties, the probability of Hoyle remaining Speaker until March 1, 2024, is lower than it would be under normal circumstances. However, the mitigating factors suggest that it is not a certainty that he will be removed.\n\nConsidering the balance of these factors, the initial probability of Hoyle remaining Speaker is moderately low but not negligible.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.35</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of Speakers being removed from office due to controversies. Historically, it is relatively rare for a Speaker to be removed, especially within such a short timeframe. The introduction of a no-confidence motion is significant, but it does not guarantee removal. The mitigating factors, such as Hoyle's apology and the lack of explicit rule-breaking, suggest that there is still a reasonable chance he will remain in office.\n\nGiven the historical context and the specific circumstances of this controversy, the initial probability of 0.35 seems slightly too low. Adjusting for the base rate and the mitigating factors, a more balanced probability would be slightly higher.\n\nFinal probability adjustment:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.45*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "The UK\u2019s House of Commons has descended into chaos as the government and the Scottish National Party (SNP) condemned Speaker Lindsay Hoyle for his handling of a key vote on support for a ceasefire in Gaza. Lawmakers from the SNP and the governing Conservative Party walked out of the chamber on Wednesday in an apparent protest at the speaker\u2019s actions. The uproar followed a decision by Hoyle to ignore precedent and allow a vote that helped the opposition Labour Party \u2013 which is tipped to win a national election later this year \u2013 avoid a large-scale rebellion among its own lawmakers over its position on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. The debate in parliament was initiated by the SNP, which put forward a motion calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza. Labour and the Conservatives then proposed amendments, with different conditions they said were necessary before there should be a pause in fighting. The amendments sought an \u201cimmediate humanitarian pause\u201d \u2013 and not a ceasefire \u2013 and said that \u201cIsrael cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence\u201d. In an unusual move, Hoyle selected both those amendments to be voted on, breaking with the precedent whereby one opposition party cannot alter another\u2019s motion. Usually, only the government amendment would be selected. Some lawmakers jeered the speaker when he announced his decision. During the chaos, the Labour amendment was eventually approved verbally, without a formal vote where individual lawmakers\u2019 views are recorded. One member of parliament accused Hoyle, a former Labour lawmaker, of causing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d. The government\u2019s Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt said Hoyle had \u201chijacked\u201d the debate and \u201cundermined the confidence\u201d of the House and said the government was pulling out of proceedings. Hoyle\u2019s decision allowed the Labour Party to avoid a potentially damaging split over the SNP motion. A similar motion, also tabled by the SNP in November, saw Labour leader Keir Starmer suffer the biggest revolt of his leadership. Starmer, who initially gave full backing to Israel as it embarked on its war, is under increasing pressure from Labour lawmakers and party members to back an immediate ceasefire. Al Jazeera\u2019s Harry Fawcett, reporting from London, said Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201chas ended in this real farce\u201d. \u201cThe Labour amendment [went] through because no Conservatives took part in the vote. The SNP motion, which began the whole story, was not voted on at all; the SNP and Conservatives are furious,\u201d he said. \u201cKeir Starmer [and] his Labour Party have kind of gotten out of a sticky mess, but it leaves parliament looking extremely compromised. What was a serious debate about this crucial issue about civilian life in Gaza has ended in this procedural nightmare.\u201d Ian Blackford, an SNP MP, told Al Jazeera that the day\u2019s events in parliament had distracted from events in Gaza and made the eventual vote less impactful. \u201c[The Labour Party] came up with this proposition that allowed them to have a vote, and the purpose of that \u2013 particularly when the government party [the Conservatives] wouldn\u2019t participate in it \u2013 meant that our meaningful vote \u2026 wasn\u2019t taken,\u201d Blackford said. \u201cI regret that tonight we\u2019re having to discuss this, rather than discuss the need of protecting the people in Gaza that need that ceasefire to take place.\u201d One Conservative MP, William Wragg, has brought forward a parliamentary motion expressing no confidence in the speaker, a sign of the anger of some parliamentarians at what is perceived to be a deviation from the speaker\u2019s traditionally neutral role. Hoyle returned to the House of Commons later in the evening and apologised. \u201cI have tried to do what I thought was the right thing for all sides of this House,\u201d Hoyle said. \u201cIt is regrettable, and I apologise that the decision didn\u2019t end up in the place that I wished.\u201d",

The motion \u201ccondemns any military assault on what is now the largest refugee camp in the world\u201d and \u201cfurther calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken by Hamas and an end to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people\u201d. What did Labour\u2019s amendment to the Gaza ceasefire motion say? Labour proposed an amendment to the SNP motion which, as well as describing the \u201closs of Palestinian life\u201d as \u201cintolerable\u201d, calls for an \u201cimmediate stop to the fighting and a ceasefire\u201d that \u201clasts and is observed by all sides\u201d. The Labour wording spells out explicitly a concern that some commentators sympathetic to Israel have raised in response to pro-Palestinian activists demanding a ceasefire. The Labour motion \u201cnot[es] that Israel cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence and that Israelis have the right to the assurance that the horror of 7 October 2023 cannot happen again\u201d. What did the Conservative government\u2019s amendment to the Gaza motion say? The government also proposed its own amendment, emphasising support for \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to self-defence, in compliance with international humanitarian law\u201d, and highlighting and condemning \u201cthe slaughter, abuse and gender-based violence perpetrated on 7 October 2023\u201d. The government\u2019s text also \u201creaffirms the urgent need to significantly scale up the flow of aid into Gaza, where too many innocent civilians have died\u201d and \u201ccalls on all parties to take immediate steps to stop the fighting and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.\u201d Why was Lindsay Hoyle\u2019s decision on the Gaza vote controversial? As Speaker, it\u2019s up to Lindsay Hoyle to decide which amendments are considered and in what order. The expectation on opposition days is that the party in charge gets to move their motion first \u2013 in this case, it would be the SNP. But on this occasion, the Speaker picked the Labour amendment. This was met with consternation by SNP and Conservative MPs, with one reportedly describing the decision as \u201covertly political\u201d. The complaint from some is that the day was structured like this to help Labour avoid a tight political spot. Keir Starmer\u2019s whips had previously asked their MPs to abstain on the SNP motion. But with Commons business arranged in this way, Labour can reduce the threat of MPs rebelling and backing the SNP proposal in defiance of their leader. Responding to the decision, one of Parliament\u2019s most senior officials, the Clerk of the House of Commons Tom Goldsmith, wrote to the Speaker to \u201cput on record his view\u201d. While Mr Goldsmith acknowledged that Mr Hoyle\u2019s actions are \u201cnot specifically precluded\u201d by any of the Standing Orders that govern parliamentary procedures, he said he felt \u201ccompelled to point out that long-established conventions are not being followed in this case\u201d. Announcing his decision to MPs, Lindsay Hoyle said that in his opinion, Standing Order 31 (which sets out how opposition day debates are run), \u201creflects an outdated approach\u201d. He said that his alternative arrangement \u201cwill allow a vote to take place potentially on all proposals from each of the three main parties\u201d. \u201cI think it is important on this occasion that the House is able to consider the widest possible range of options\u201d, he said.",

          "raw_content": "Speaker of the house Sir Lindsay Hoyle is facing calls to resign after a Commons vote on a ceasefire in Gaza descended into chaos last night. 57 MPs have submitted a vote of no confidence in the speaker after he broke with convention to wave through a Labour amendment to the SNP\u2019s motion calling for an \u2018immediate humanitarian ceasefire\u2019, which later passed without a formal vote. The speaker apologised to Parliament after Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt claimed Sir Lindsay had \u2018hijacked\u2019 the debate and \u2018undermined the confidence\u2019 of the House, prompting Tory and SNP MPs to stage a walk-out in disgust. But what does this all mean, and why is the Speaker now facing calls to resign? Metro.co.uk has the answers. Who is Sir Lindsay Hoyle? A mainstay of British politics, Sir Lindsay has dedicated much of his life to public service. His father, Doug Hoyle, was a former Labour MP, representing Nelson and Colne from 1974 to 1979 and Warrington North from 1981 to 1997 before being made a life peer in 1999. Prior to his entry into national politics, the Lancashire-born MP became the youngest ever councillor to serve Chorley when he was elected in 1980 at the age of 22. He then spent nearly two decades serving as Deputy Leader of Chorley Council, and then Mayor of Chorley in 1997-1998. What party was he a member of? Sir Lindsay has been a member of the Labour party since a young age, and was chosen to stand as the Labour candidate for the Chorley constituency at the 1997 general election. He won the election with a majority of 9,870, becoming the first Labour MP for Chorley in eighteen years. During his parliamentary career, Hoyle served as a member of the Trade and Industry Committee from 1998 to 2010 and as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee from 2005 to 2010. He also served as Deputy Speaker to his predecessor John Bercow from 2010 to 2019, before being elected to the post himself on November 4, 2019. Hoyle was later unanimously re-elected as Speaker five days after the 2019 general election. In his acceptance speech, Hoyle stated that stated he would be a \u2018transparent\u2019 Speaker and said he would \u2018change the House for the better\u2019. He also emphasised his commitment the wellbeing of House of Commons staff, pledging to take their welfare seriously. In recognition of his contributions to parliament and politics, Hoyle received a knighthood in the 2018 New Year Honours, becoming only the third Speaker of the British House of Commons to possess a knighthood at the point of his election. What happened in the House of Commons? Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt claimed Sir Lindsay had \u2018hijacked\u2019 the debate and \u2018undermined the confidence\u2019 of the House in its long-standing rules by selecting Labour\u2019s bid to amend the SNP motion calling for an \u2018immediate ceasefire\u2019 in the Israel-Hamas war. It had been expected that Sir Lindsay would select just the government\u2019s amendment seeking an \u2018immediate humanitarian pause\u2019 to the Israel-Hamas conflict, which could pave the way for a more permanent stop in fighting. But instead, he decided that the Commons would first vote on Labour\u2019s calls for an \u2018immediate humanitarian ceasefire\u2019 before moving on to further votes on the SNP\u2019s original motion, and then the government\u2019s proposals if either of the first two were to fail to garner enough support. Sir Lindsay, who was first elected as a Labour MP but followed tradition following his election as Speaker by relinquishing his party affiliation, was accused of upending long-standing parliamentary conventions under which rival opposition amendments to an Opposition Day debate are not usually chosen alongside Government amendments. Why did the SNP walk out? SNP MPs and some Conservatives walked out of the chamber in protest at Speaker Sir Lindsay\u2019s handling of the Gaza ceasefire debate. The decision ultimately meant the SNP were unable to vote on their own proposition. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said he would take significant convincing that the Speaker\u2019s position was \u2018not now intolerable\u2019 and claimed his party had been treated with \u2018complete and utter contempt\u2019. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Flynn said: \u2018Mr Speaker, whilst I acknowledge your apology, the reality is that you were warned by the clerks of the House that your decision could lead to the SNP not having a vote on our very own Opposition Day. \u2018As a result, we have seen the SNP Opposition Day turn into a Labour Party Opposition Day. \u2018I am afraid that that is treating myself and my colleagues in the Scottish National Party with complete and utter contempt. I will take significant convincing that your position is not now intolerable.\u2019 What has Lindsay Hoyle said? Sir Lindsay has apologised for his actions and said he will speak with \u2018the key players\u2019 of all parties to decide what will happen going forward. He said his decision was taken with \u2018the right intentions\u2019, to allow MPs \u2018the widest range of propositions on which to express a view\u2019. Appearing near tears in the Commons, he explained: \u2018I wanted to do the best, and it was my wish\u2026 to do the best by every member of this House. \u2018The danger is\u2026 that that\u2019s why I wanted everybody to express\u2026 because I am very, very concerned about the security of all members\u2026 I was very concerned, I am still concerned, and that\u2019s why the meetings I have had today is about the security of members, their families and the people that are involved. \u2018And I\u2019ve got to say, I regret how it\u2019s ended up. It was not my intention. I wanted all to ensure they could express their views and all sides of the House could vote. \u2018As it was, in particular the SNP were ultimately unable to vote on their proposition. \u2018I am, and I regret\u2026 with my sadness, that it\u2019s ended up\u2026 in this position. That was never my intention for it to end like this. \u2018I was absolutely convinced that the decision was done with the right intentions. I recognise the strength of feeling of members on this issue.\u2019 Who is the deputy speaker? Deputy Speaker Dame Rosie Winterton fielded multiple questions in Sir Lindsay\u2019s absence, before he returned to the Commons. She was forced to deny reports that Sir Lindsay\u2019s decision to include the Labour amendment was due to pressure from the Labour Party. She also refused to suspend the house while MPs clamoured for Sir Lindsay to return to the Commons. Dame Rosie is the Labour MP for Doncaster Central and has served as an MP since 1997. She served under Tony Blair as a minister in the Department for Health, then under Gordon Brown as the Minister of State for Transport in 2007-8, Minister for Work and Pensions in 2008-9, and Minister for Local Government in 2009-10. What happens next? Sir Lindsay will likely be considering his position, as he has lost the support of the SNP, the third-largest political party. Mr Flynn called for an investigation, as he appeared to suggest Sir Keir and Labour chief whip Alan Campbell exerted pressure on the Speaker ahead of his decision to pick Labour\u2019s amendment. But Labour still seems to back the Speaker, with frontbencher John Healey saying: \u2018The Speaker was trying to ensure the widest possible debate on something that matters to parliament, it matters to our communities, it matters around the world. \u2018He was doing the right thing.\u2019 It\u2019s clear Sir Lindsay regrets his actions, having apologised to the House \u2013 but it\u2019s not yet clear whether this will save his political career.

          "raw_content": "Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial prorogation of Parliament has been ruled \u201cunlawful\u201d by the Supreme Court. The panel of 11 justices was unanimous in the decision, after listening to evidence on the legality of the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend the House of Commons for five weeks. They heard historic appeals that arose out of separate legal challenges in England and Scotland, which produced differing outcomes. Johnson\u2019s opponents argued that it was an \u201cunlawful abuse of power\u201d aimed at silencing MPs, while his lawyers tried to claim that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to rule on the length of prorogation. Speaker John Bercow has said the House of Commons will resume at 11.30am on Wednesday. So what is proroguing? Prorogation is the formal term for the end of a parliamentary session and is marked with a ceremony in the House of Lords. It normally entails an announcement and speech on behalf of the Queen. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013Sign up for our free Countdown to Brexit newsletter, a weekly guide to the gravity and absurdity of British politics\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 According to Parliament.uk, once the Commons has been prorogued, all motions that have not been answered, or Bills that have not obtained Royal Assent, will not progress any further. Neither House can meet, debate and pass legislation. A Bill can, however, be reintroduced in the next session by an MP or continue in the next session if a carry-over motion has been passed. While prorogation is a normal process, the length of suspension in this case - from 9 September to 14 October - was deemed unusually long. Opponents feared the government was sending MPs away to stop them blocking the UK\u2019s exit from the EU with or without a deal. Johnson\u2019s prorogation \u201cdoes seem like a very obvious move to cut down the time available for anti-no-deal MPs to do something about it\u201d, the Institute for Government\u2019s Catherine Haddon told the BBC. iNews adds that, \u201chistorically, this method has been used by monarchs to stop Parliament from interfering with their plans\u201d. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013For more political analysis - and a concise, refreshing and balanced take on the week\u2019s news agenda - try The Week magazine.

While proroguing happens at the end of every session, dissolution only occurs before an election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, Parliament is dissolved 25 days before an election - but prorogation can predate that, and kill all the House\u2019s business while Parliament technically still exists. The BBC notes that the latest session had been going for two years - since the 2017 election - \u201cas it was extended to tackle the legislation for Brexit\u201d. Prorogation is also different from a \u201crecess\u201d, when the House does not sit but parliamentary business can otherwise continue as usual. Is there a precedent for this? This sort of thing \u201cmakes officials rather nervous\u201d, says Politico, although Theresa May\u2019s former legislative adviser Nikki da Costa notes it has been done before. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, she says: \u201cThis is not to be done lightly, but there is historical precedent. In 1948 a new Parliament Bill to reduce the power of the Lords was being blocked by peers, but powers\u2026 which would allow the government to override the Lords could only be used if there had been a delay over three \u2018sessions\u2019. A special short session of 10 days was therefore arranged.\u201d Reacting to Johnson\u2019s plan to ask the Queen to suspend Parliament, Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly defended the plan as something \u201call new governments do\u201d. Could the Queen have refused? The Queen technically has the power to refuse the Government\u2019s request to suspend Parliament, but constitutionally a refusal is impossible. Under the British Parliamentary democracy, the Queen acts on the advice of her prime minister. That means that decisions over when Parliament sits are decided by the Government, and only rubber-stamped by Buckingham Palace. What did the Supreme Court rule? Today, the Supreme Court justices said: \u201cThe decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions.\u201d Therefore the prorogation is \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d, meaning Parliament has not been suspended. Over the weekend, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cOf course we will respect whatever the legal ruling is from the Supreme Court.\u201d He added that there may be \u201cdifferent permutations as to what the Supreme Court may or may not decide\u201d and that \u201clater in the week we\u2019ll obviously want to look at that very carefully\u201d. But today\u2019s ruling was very clear.",

          "raw_content": "Tom Goldsmith, who as \u201cClerk of the House\u201d is the chief adviser on matters of parliamentary procedure, warned Hoyle that his decision had no precedent in the last 25 years. READ MORE: LIVE: MPs to vote on SNP's Gaza ceasefire motion The SNP have hit out at Hoyle for changing the rules to allow Labour\u2019s amendment, with reports saying they are talking to the Tories about ousting him as Speaker. MP Stewart McDonald said Hoyle was guilty of doing Labour, his old party, a \u201cnakedly political favour\u201d. Ordinarily, a second opposition party's amendment to another's motion would not be debated. But Hoyle decided to allow Labour's amendment to an SNP motion. Goldsmith sent a letter to Hoyle putting on the record his concerns about the decision. You can read Tom Goldsmith\u2019s full letter to Lindsay Hoyle here: Dear Mr Speaker, In January 2020, you wrote to my predecessor establishing a procedure by which he could record his views regarding any of your decisions which he felt comprised a substantial breach of the Standing Orders or a departure from long-established conventions. You asked him to place in the Library a note of any such view and you undertook to make the House aware if he did so. I am today exercising the opportunity to place on record my view that the decision to allow an official opposition spokesperson to speak and to move an amendment before a Government minister in response to an SNP spokesperson moving their opposition day motion represents a departure from the long-established convention for dealing with such amendments on opposition days, governed by Standing Order No 31. Where an orderly Government amendment to leave out some words of the motion and insert others is tabled and selected, the expectation is that such an amendment is then moved by the minister in the second speech of the debate and, once the amendment has been moved, the Standing Order provides that the first question considered by the House at the end of the debate must be on the text of the original motion. If that is negatived, the question is put on the Government's amendment. When introducing the proposal in 1979 the Leader of the House said the arrangements were \"so that a vote could take place on the Opposition's own motion\" (Hansard 31 October 1979 vol 972 c1278). The procedural impact of the decision taken today is that the first division is likely to be on the official opposition's amendment rather than on the SNP's motion; and, depending on the outcome of any such division, it is possible that the House will not be able to vote on the SNP motion (nor on the Government's alternative proposition). In taking this step, I recognise that: a) Your decision is not specifically precluded by any Standing Order; b) The Speaker and his Deputies have complete discretion regarding the order in which to call Members to speak; c) The Speaker has discretion over which amendments to select; d) There have been two occasions in the last 25 years or so when an amendment has been moved by an opposition party Member from a party other than the one to which the day had been allotted (as well as one when a government backbencher moved an amendment) and on one of those occasions, the Official Opposition Member was called to move his amendment before a minister was called \u2014 however, in those few circumstances, no Government amendment had been tabled; and e) You have been motivated by giving the House what you considered to be the widest choice of decisions on alternative propositions, on a subject of immense importance, on which people in and outside the House have the strongest of views. Nevertheless, I know that you understand why I feel compelled to point out that long- established conventions are not being followed in this case. I am grateful to you for making every effort to discuss this with me extensively and for taking full account of my views when reaching your decision, which I know was not an easy one, and which of course is one for you to make. Yours sincerely, Tom Goldsmith Clerk of the House",

      "1. **Compress key factual information:**\n\n<facts>\n- Chasiv Yar is strategically significant for both Ukraine and Russia.\n- Russia aims to capture Chasiv Yar by May 9, 2024.\n- As of May 9, 2024, there is no specific information confirming that Russia has captured Chasiv Yar.\n- Russian forces have made substantial advances near Avdiivka and other areas in the Donetsk region.\n- Ukraine is experiencing a shortage of weapons and soldiers, impacting its defense capabilities.\n- U.S. military aid to Ukraine has been delayed, affecting Ukraine's ability to defend key positions.\n- Russian forces have increased bombardments and armored vehicle presence in Chasiv Yar.\n- Ukrainian officials have expressed concerns about the potential fall of Chasiv Yar and its implications for nearby towns.\n- Russia has a significant artillery advantage and is mobilizing more soldiers.\n</facts>\n\n2. **Reasons why the answer might be no:**\n\n<no>\n- **Ukrainian Defense Efforts (Strength: 6):** Despite shortages, Ukraine is still actively defending Chasiv Yar and other key positions. The strategic importance of Chasiv Yar means Ukraine is likely to prioritize its defense.\n- **Western Aid (Strength: 5):** Although delayed, Western military aid could arrive in time to bolster Ukrainian defenses and prevent the fall of Chasiv Yar.\n- **Russian Logistical Challenges (Strength: 4):** Russia may face logistical and operational challenges in maintaining its advances, especially if Ukrainian resistance is strong.\n</no>\n\n3. **Reasons why the answer might be yes:**\n\n<yes>\n- **Current Russian Advances (Strength: 8):** Russian forces have made significant territorial gains in the Donetsk region, and their increased presence in Chasiv Yar suggests they are close to capturing it.\n- **Ukrainian Shortages (Strength: 7):** Ukraine's shortages of weapons and soldiers severely limit its ability to defend Chasiv Yar effectively.\n- **Artillery Advantage (Strength: 6):** Russia's substantial artillery advantage and increased bombardments make it difficult for Ukraine to hold its positions.\n- **Strategic Importance (Strength: 5):** The strategic importance of Chasiv Yar for Russia means they are likely to commit significant resources to capture it.\n</yes>\n\n4. **Aggregate considerations:**\n\n<thinking>\nThe competing factors suggest a complex situation. On one hand, Ukraine's active defense efforts and potential arrival of Western aid could bolster their ability to hold Chasiv Yar. On the other hand, Russia's current advances, artillery advantage, and the strategic importance of Chasiv Yar make it likely that they will continue to push hard to capture the city.\n\nThe key interaction here is between the timing and effectiveness of Western aid and Ukrainian defense efforts versus the momentum and resources of the Russian offensive. Given the current state of affairs, the balance seems to tilt slightly in favor of Russia capturing Chasiv Yar, but there remains significant uncertainty due to potential changes in the dynamics of the conflict.\n</thinking>\n\n5. **Initial probability:**\n\n<tentative>0.65</tentative>\n\n6. **Reflection and sanity checks:**\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rates of city captures in similar conflicts and the specific context of the Ukraine-Russia war. Historically, urban warfare can be protracted, and even with significant advantages, capturing a city can take longer than anticipated. Additionally, the arrival of Western aid, even if delayed, could shift the balance.\n\nGiven the strategic importance of Chasiv Yar, both sides are likely to commit substantial resources, which could lead to a prolonged battle rather than a quick capture. The initial probability of 0.65 might be slightly overestimating the likelihood of a quick Russian capture given these considerations.\n\nAdjusting for these factors, a more conservative estimate would be prudent to account for the inherent uncertainties and the potential for Ukrainian resilience bolstered by incoming aid.\n</thinking>\n\n7. **Final prediction:**\n\n<answer>*0.60*</answer>"

President Vladimir Putin, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was flanked by veterans as he watched thousands of Russian troops, tanks, armored vehicles and weaponry parade through a mostly rainy Red Square in Moscow. Alexander Nemenov | Afp | Getty Images The May 9 event commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II but the Kremlin keen to cast parallels between the Red Army's victory in 1945 and the current conflict in Ukraine. In other news, a Ukrainian air attack on Russia's Belgorod region injured eight people and damaged scores of residential buildings and cars, the governor of the border region said Thursday. Among the wounded is an 11-year-old girl who was taken to a hospital, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine's Parliament votes in favor of bill that cracks down on draft dodgers The Ukrainian Parliament on Thursday voted in favor of a bill that aims to crack down on Ukrainians dodging being drafted to the country's armed forces, Reuters reported. Fines for anyone trying to avoid being called up to fight would be increased and authorities would be allowed to detain draft dodgers for up to three days under the new bill. The bill was backed by a majority of lawmakers, but still needs to be signed into law by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Michael Kappeler | Picture Alliance | Getty Images This comes as Ukraine has been struggling with a shortage of soldiers, which has prompted the government to come up with various new ways to expand its army's manpower. Earlier in the week the Ukrainian Parliament passed a bill allowing some prisoners to enlist. A new mobilization law is also due to come into effect, which lowers the minimum age for army recruits among other provisions. \u2014 Sophie Kiderlin Ukraine's special operations commander replaced for second time in six months Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy replaced the commander of the country's special operations forces for the second time in six months on Thursday. For special operations chief Colonel Serhiy Lupanchuk was replaced with Brigadier General Oleksandr Trepak, two decrees published on the Ukrainian president's website that were Google-translated by CNBC, said. Lupanchuk had held the role since November. No explanation was given for the change. The special operations forces unit operates in Ukrainian territories that are currently controlled by Russia. \u2014 Sophie Kiderlin Russia and Belarus to carry out joint tactical nuclear weapons drills, Putin says Alexandr Demyanchuk | AFP | Getty Images Russia and Belarus will join forces to carry out tactical nuclear weapons drills, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. \"Since non-strategic nuclear weapons are stationed on the territory of Belarus, this time we invited our friends, allies, and the President of Belarus [Alexander Lukashenko] asked for this, to take part in one of the stages of this exercise. We conduct them regularly,\" Putin said, according the Interfax news agency. Non-strategic \u2014 or tactical \u2014 nuclear weapons are designed for use in battlefield situations as opposed to their larger and more destructive counterparts, strategic nuclear weapons, which could destroy entire cities. Russia and its neighbor and ally Belarus had both announced their intentions earlier this week to carry out their own drills. Russia has stationed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus but retains control over the weapons. Russia said its decision to station such hardware in Belarus was no different to the U.S.' positioning of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Russia agrees to withdraw troops, border guards from some parts of Armenia Russia has agreed to withdraw its military and border guards from some parts of Armenia, the Kremlin said Thursday. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan reached an agreement on the withdrawal of troops at a meeting Thursday, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said, RIA Novosti reported. \"Due to the fact that conditions have changed ... Pashinyan and Putin agreed on this issue,\" Peskov said. Russian border guards will remain on the border with Iran and Turkey at the request of the Armenian side, Peskov said. Relations between Russia and Armenia have been strained in recent years as Pashinyan, in power since 2018, has forged closer alliances with Europe. Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty Images Relations deteriorated further when Russia turned a blind eye to its rival, Azerbaijan, launching a lightning offensive to seize the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, an area where Russia had stationed several thousand peacekeeping troops. Russia's lack of intervention was widely seen as due to its hands being tied with the war in Ukraine and as a way to punish Armenia for its leanings toward the West. Russian peacekeepers withdrew from Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan reclaimed the region. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Former army chief Zaluzhny to become Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Yan Dobronosov | Getty Images Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed the former army chief Valery Zaluzhny as Ukraine's new ambassador to the U.K. Zaluzhny was a popular and respected figurehead in Ukraine's armed forces but reportedly fell out with Zelenskyy over the country's military strategy, and after publicly warning last fall that the war had reached a stalemate. Zelenskyy rejected the characterization. In February, Zaluzhny was replaced with Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi who has himself warned of a deteriorating situation on the front line in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskyy and Zaluzhny have done their best to maintain a united front since the latter's departure from office. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Russia says it's compelled to boost nuclear deterrent because of the West Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned Thursday that Moscow was inclined to bolster its nuclear deterrent because of what he described as the West's \"escalatory course\" vis-\u00e0-vis Russia. Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty Images \"Possibilities for the first use of nuclear weapons are clearly stated in the military doctrine and in the fundamentals of state policy in the area of nuclear deterrence. At the moment, there are no changes with regard to this,\" Ryabkov said, according to comments reported by news agency RIA Novosti and translated by NBC News. \"But the situation itself is changing, so how the basic documents in this area relate to the needs of ensuring our security is the subject of constant analysis,\" he said. \"We warn our opponents that their escalatory course, of course, confronts us with the need to take steps that actually mean strengthening measures of deterrence,\" he added. Exercises involving the use of tactical nuclear weapons were an element of those efforts, he added. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Oil processing plant in Russia's Bashkiria region was attacked by a drone, says regional head Russia's Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat oil processing, petrochemical and fertiliser plant in the Bashkiria region was attacked by a drone but is functioning as usual, Radiy Khabirov, the region's head, said on his Telegram channel on Thursday. \u2014 Reuters Victory Day 2024: In pictures Moscow has seen all kinds of weather during its 2024 Victory Day parade today, from sunshine to showers and even a blizzard. But that wouldn't be enough to stop the event \u2014 the military parade is a highlight in Russia's public calendar and an important part of the country's national identity and psyche, recalling the Red Army's defeat of Nazi Germany at a great cost to Russia. Around 27 million Russian soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died during World War II. Russia and the U.S. and U.K., are now more enemies than allies as the war continues in Ukraine.

Solsky, 44, has denied the allegations. He has been at the centre of Ukraine's effort to keep its grain industry going as Russia's full-scale invasion has blocked Black Sea export routes, strewn fields with landmines and seen farmland occupied. \u2014 Reuters Russia 'will not allow anyone to threaten us,' Putin tells Victory Parade Mikhail Metzel | Sputnik | Reuters Russia President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia will do everything it can to avoid a global confrontation but said the country would \"not allow anyone to threaten us.\" Addressing thousands of troops, officials, veterans and guests at the May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow \u2014 an annual event that marks the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II \u2014 Putin said Russia's strategic nuclear forces were always combat-ready.

Accusing the West of stoking conflicts around the world, Putin said \"we know what the exorbitance of such ambitions leads to. Russia will do everything to prevent a global clash,\" he said, in comments translated by Reuters. \"But at the same time, we will not allow anyone to threaten us.

Russian forces have used the \u201cartillery drought\u201d hampering Ukraine\u2019s defenses since December to push forward on the eastern front near Avdiivka, making the largest advance since the early months of the war. Moscow\u2019s progress has prompted warnings from senior Ukrainian military officials of a possible threat to Kyiv\u2019s supply lines and hubs in the east, which are now perilously close to being in range of superior Russian firepower. The bleak news of progress comes ahead of an anticipated Russian offensive in late May, which could threaten Ukraine\u2019s presence in the Donetsk region and hard-fought, if modest, gains towards the occupied port city of Mariupol. Russia has thrown vast resources at weak Ukrainian defenses across the eastern frontlines, pushing toward three key points: the vital military hub of Pokrovsk, west of Avdiivka; the strategic heights of Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut; and Kurakhove in the southeast. On February 17, Ukraine announced it had withdrawn from Avdiivka, a town battled over for a decade, one which Russia appears to have sacrificed hundreds of troops to take. Yet Moscow\u2019s advance did not stop there. Over the next 10 weeks, as a CNN map and analysis by the Ukrainian monitoring group DeepStateMap shows, Russian forces slowly took village after village to Avdiivka\u2019s west, taking advantage of Kyiv\u2019s failure to build fortifications and reluctance to publicly state the extent of their territorial losses in that area. Only on Sunday did the top Ukrainian military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, admit the fall of a series of villages that his subordinates had insisted for days were still contested. The resulting fallback showed Russian forces had, in just over two months, made the most substantial and swift progress since July 2022\u2019s advances near Severodonetsk, according to a CNN analysis. The Ukrainian reluctance to admit these losses led to public criticism from some pro-Ukrainian military bloggers and analysts. DeepStateMap, which updates the frontline situation daily, showed significant losses near Avdiivka. One of the group\u2019s founders, Ruslan Mykula, told CNN they spoke out because they had felt a military \u201cspokesperson has the opportunity to check the real situation, but he [still] provides untrue information and this undermines our credibility.\u201d Mykula said the Russian advances near Ocheretyne, a village taken by Russia in the past weeks west of Avdiivka, are \u201ca tactical success so far,\u201d but could become \u201ca strategic one.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the current situation, it will be very difficult to stop the enemy because it is pushing where the defense was not paying enough attention.\u201d He said there was a lack of defensive fortifications along the Avdiivka \u201centire left flank\u201d \u2014 which would effectively mean open plains are now vulnerable almost as far as a key highway that leads to the strategic Ukrainian hub of Pokrovsk. Tuesday\u2019s update from the Ukrainian general staff said their forces were defending a series of villages much closer to Pokrovsk than is comfortable. Tuesday\u2019s presidential address from Volodymyr Zelensky demanded a \u201csignificant acceleration of [Western] supplies to significantly strengthen the capabilities of our soldiers.\u201d He said Kyiv\u2019s defenses needed a \u201cstrength that must prove itself in the Pokrovsk direction,\u201d along with other perilous frontlines to the south near Kurakh\u043eve, but also to the northeast near Kupiansk. Further Russian advances towards Kurakhove in the southeastern part of this frontline could imperil gains made by Ukraine during the summer counteroffensive. To the north, Russia is regularly bombarding Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, but also pushing hard along the frontlines near Kupiansk, to reoccupy territory liberated by Ukraine in a lightning advance in the late summer of 2022. Ukrainian officials have also warned publicly about the threat to Chasiv Yar, a small town near the city of Bakhmut, brutally torn from Ukrainian control last May. Chasiv Yar sits on a hill, and Lt. Col Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the Ukrainian Khortytsia command, said Tuesday on Ukrainian television that Russian forces were aiming to push along the canal near it, and seize it to gain a strategic advantage over vital nearby Ukrainian military towns. \u201cIt would be very important for them to take Chasiv Yar before we receive foreign aid \u2026 when we stop having a shortage of ammunition,\u201d Voloshyn told Ukrainian television. \u201cIf the enemy captures the dominant heights and the occupiers gain a foothold there, it will be a big problem for us, because Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk and Druzhkivka will immediately come under attack.\u201d If those four towns, which sit along the same highway, were to come under serious threat of capture, Russia\u2019s goal of control over the entire Donetsk region would come much closer to fruition.",

For months, Ukrainian military personnel have described the battlefield situation as dire due to a shortage of weapons and soldiers amid a renewed Russian offensive. They have reported increased Russian bombardment using guided air bombs, dropped from their planes onto Ukrainian military positions. With resources running low, this assault in eastern Ukraine could threaten larger towns and cities such as Kostiantynivka, just west of Chasiv Yar \u2014 potentially advancing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region, which he has already declared, illegally, to be annexed by Russia. Chasiv Yar \u2014 west of the city of Bakhmut, which Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenaries captured and occupied nearly a year ago \u2014 is now the new focus of Moscow\u2019s forces, commanders fighting in the area said. \u201cThey systematically try to advance,\u201d said a deputy battalion commander in the 24th Separate Assault Battalion, better known as Aidar. The Washington Post agreed to identify the commander by his call sign, Chichen, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. \u201cWe now see, due to their assaults, a large number of [Russian] armored vehicles knocked out on the outskirts,\u201d Chichen said, adding that on Friday morning, some 20 units of heavy equipment were part of the Russian assault. \u201cLiterally six months ago, this did not happen here,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is a lot of burned-out equipment.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s worsening battlefield situation has coincided with Republicans in Congress blocking, for more than six months, $60 billion in security aid for Ukraine proposed by President Biden. During that time, Russia has regained the offensive initiative, initially by overtaking the town of Avdiivka in February. Moscow\u2019s forces have continued to advance past Avdiivka in the southern part of the Donetsk region. And on a separate axis, they are now encroaching on Chasiv Yar \u2014 a two-pronged attack. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are concerned that Russia is preparing to mobilize hundreds of thousands more soldiers for another potential offensive in the northeast, toward Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Kharkiv in recent weeks has been pummeled repeatedly by missiles, and strikes on energy infrastructure have disrupted electrical service. Elsewhere in the southeast, Ukrainian forces have been fighting to maintain the few gains they made during a counteroffensive last summer, towns such as Robotyne, south of the city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian and Western officials have warned that without the U.S. support \u2014 particularly in providing air defense and artillery ammunition \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s defense along the front line could crumble. Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. general overseeing military operations in Europe, warned U.S. lawmakers this week that Russia is expected to hold a 10-1 advantage on artillery shells \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d Oleksander, a Ukrainian battalion commander fighting on the left flank of Chasiv Yar, said Russians are now assaulting the town directly as well as other villages at its edges. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. In recent days, the Russians had reached the outskirts of the town, he said, and he predicted that if Ukraine does not withdraw from Chasiv Yar the end of the month, fighting will probably already be taking place in the town\u2019s center. Chichen, the Aidar deputy battalion commander, said that Chasiv Yar could be strategic for Russian soldiers because it has high ground that is convenient for launching drone attacks. Defending a canal that runs through the eastern edge of the town will be key for Ukraine, he said. \u201cNow the canal is one of the main boundaries that everyone is trying to hold on to,\u201d Chichen said. \u201cIf they have to advance, then there are restrictions on the places in which they will cross it. It will be possible to pass there by infantry, but it will be more difficult for them to cross with vehicles. Therefore, the canal is quite an important thing.\u201d",

The prosecutorial request to dismiss the case against G\u00f3mez significantly reduces the legal pressure, which is a strong factor against resignation. However, S\u00e1nchez's personal distress and the public nature of his contemplation add weight to the possibility of resignation.\n\nThe support from his party and his history of political resilience suggest he might withstand the crisis. However, the lack of crisis meetings and the personal nature of his decision-making process indicate a genuine consideration of stepping down.\n\nGiven the mixed public sentiment and the strategic aspects of his resignation threat, it is plausible that S\u00e1nchez is using this as a leverage point. However, the personal distress and the public commitment to announce his decision on April 29, 2024, suggest a higher probability of resignation.\n\nBalancing these factors, the probability of S\u00e1nchez announcing his resignation before April 30, 2024, is moderately high but not certain.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.65</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of political leaders resigning under similar circumstances. Political leaders often face scandals and investigations, but actual resignations are less common unless the legal or political pressure is overwhelming.\n\nThe prosecutorial request to dismiss the case is a significant mitigating factor, suggesting that the legal threat may not be as severe as initially perceived. This could reduce the likelihood of resignation. Additionally, S\u00e1nchez's history of resilience and the support from his party are strong factors against resignation.\n\nHowever, the personal distress and the public commitment to announce his decision on April 29, 2024, remain strong indicators that he is seriously considering resignation. The lack of crisis meetings and the personal nature of his decision-making process further support this.\n\nConsidering these factors, the initial probability of 0.65 seems reasonable but slightly high given the mitigating factors. Adjusting for these considerations, a more calibrated probability would be slightly lower.\n\nFinal probability: 0.60\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.60*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "On Wednesday night, Spain\u2019s socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, abruptly announced he was cancelling his public duties for the rest of the week and considering resigning from office. He said he would announce his decision on Monday. What prompted the shock announcement? Although Spanish politics has become increasingly polarised, personal and bitter over recent years, S\u00e1nchez said he had felt compelled to consider his position after what he called a baseless \u201charassment and bullying operation\u201d conducted against him and his wife by political opponents and hostile sections of the rightwing and far-right media. The announcement came hours after a Madrid court said it had opened an investigation into S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, \u201cfor the alleged offence of influence peddling and corruption\u201d. The investigation followed a complaint from the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands). Who are Manos Limpias? The group \u2013 which describes itself as an independent national trade union committed to \u201cbringing about the independence of the judiciary and the true and real democratisation of our institutions\u201d \u2013 is headed by a lawyer called Miguel Bernad, who is known to have had links in the past to Spain\u2019s far right. In 2021, Bernad was sentenced to four years in prison over a scheme to extort major firms, but was acquitted by the supreme court last month because of a lack of evidence. Manos Limpias has a long history of using the courts to pursue those it deems to be acting contrary to what it considers to be Spain\u2019s democratic interests. Under Spanish law, individuals and groups can use a mechanism known as the acusaci\u00f3n popular (people\u2019s accusation) to put criminal complaints before a judge, who then examines them and decides whether or not to proceed. What are the allegations on which the complaint is based? Manos Limpias has accused G\u00f3mez of using her influence as the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master\u2019s degree course she ran. The court has not provided any details yet, but its statement came shortly after the online news site El Confidencial said investigators were examining G\u00f3mez\u2019s links to several private companies that received government funding or won public contracts. The site said the investigation was linked to G\u00f3mez\u2019s alleged ties with the Spanish tourism group Globalia, which owns the Air Europa airline. It said she had twice met Javier Hidalgo, Globalia\u2019s chief executive, when the carrier was in talks with the government to secure a huge bailout after it was badly hit by the loss of air traffic due to the Covid-19 crisis. At the time, G\u00f3mez was running IE Africa Center, a foundation linked to Madrid\u2019s Instituto de Empresa (IE) business school, a position she left in 2022. In a statement released on Thursday morning, Manos Limpias appeared more cautious about the allegations that had formed the basis of its complaint. The group said it had learned \u201cthrough various digital newspapers, about information that outlined alleged irregularities that could allegedly be criminal\u201d. It said it had exercised its right to put the matter before a judge, who would be best placed to determine whether the media reports were true. Madrid\u2019s prosecuting authority said on Thursday it had requested the dismissal of the case. How have those allegedly involved responded? IE said in a statement that it had never received any financial support from Globalia or its associate companies. In March, Spain\u2019s conflict of interests watchdog threw out a complaint made by the opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP), which claimed there was a link between a government bailout of Air Europa and the \u201ceconomic and professional ties\u201d of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife. In a joint statement at the time, Globalia and Air Europa said the aid received from the Spanish government was \u201cin line with the parameters of other aid received by different companies in the sector in Spain and the rest of Europe\u201d and it considered itself a victim of \u201cpolitical crossfire\u201d. What has S\u00e1nchez said? The prime minister has accused the PP and the far-right Vox party of colluding with Manos Limpias and rightwing and far-right media outlets to wage a baseless \u201charassment and bullying operation by land, air and sea\u201d in an effort to bring about his \u201cpersonal and political collapse by attacking [his] wife\u201d. In his statement on Wednesday night, he added: \u201cAs is only logical, Bego\u00f1a will defend her honour and will cooperate with the justice system as much as is necessary to clear up facts that are as scandalous in appearance as they are nonexistent.\u201d Speaking in parliament earlier the same day, the prime minister also said he still believed in the Spanish justice system \u201cdespite everything\u201d. What will happen next? That will depend on what S\u00e1nchez decides over the next few days. His allies are calling on him to remain in office.

          "raw_content": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said Wednesday he would step back from public duties \u201cfor a few days\u201d to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife\u2019s private dealings. S\u00e1nchez who last year secured another term for his Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE) as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would announce his decision on Monday, April 29. \u201cI need to pause and think,\u201d he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. \u201cAt this point, I have to ask myself: is it all worth it? I honestly don\u2019t know ... whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honor.\u201d \u201cI will cancel my public agenda for a few days in order to reflect and decide which path to take.\u201d The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into accusations of influence peddling and corruption levelled at S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez. The court investigating G\u00f3mez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and in early stages, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias \u2014 Clean Hands \u2014 whose leader has links to the far-right. Madrid\u2019s prosecuting authority on Thursday sought the dismissal of the case. Manos Limpias has accused G\u00f3mez of receiving favors from airline Air Europa and its Spanish holding company Globalia during her time as director of an African research center at Madrid\u2019s IE business school until 2022, according to a seven-page document published by radio station Cadena Ser on its website. IE said in a statement that it had never received any financial support from Globalia or its entities. Globalia did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters on Wednesday. S\u00e1nchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife has done nothing wrong and would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence. G\u00f3mez has not commented. In the letter S\u00e1nchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o of the People\u2019s Party (PP) and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had \u201ccollaborated\u201d with those circulating the claims against his wife. Feij\u00f3o said S\u00e1nchez was seeking to blame opposition parties for the activities of judges. \u201cThe prime minister has a judicial problem. He is running away from his responsibilities. What he should have done is give explanations. If you have nothing to fear, why not? If his wife has nothing to fear, she should go to court and make her innocence clear,\u201d he said. Several members of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s cabinet were seen arriving at his residence on Wednesday evening. His ministers have backed him, with Yolanda D\u00edaz, the labor minister and leader of the government\u2019s left-wing coalition partner, Sumar, saying S\u00e1nchez had her \u201cfull support.\u201d \u201cThe right-wing offensive cannot get its way,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cWe must defend democracy, the progressive bloc and the legitimacy of the coalition government that has improved people\u2019s lives so much.\u201d The announcement is in keeping with S\u00e1nchez\u2019s knack for keeping Spaniards on their toes. The 52-year-old, known as \u201cEl Guapo\u201d (Mr. Handsome), is a known risk-taker who has frequently defied the odds to secure or maintain power. Last year, he called a snap election after his PSOE party performed poorly in regional elections. After the PP won the most seats but failed to reach a majority in the July national election, he forged a controversial deal with smaller regional parties to govern that included an amnesty for Catalans who were involved in a 2017 independence push. That decision has further soured an already polarized political atmosphere and resulted in repeated attacks on him and his party from not only opposition leaders but also the judiciary. When he announced the snap election, S\u00e1nchez told very few members of his inner circle, surprising most. On Wednesday, he had told only his family and close friends and had drafted the letter himself without consulting aides, sources told Reuters. If S\u00e1nchez were to step down parliament could choose another prime minister but given its fractured nature it seemed unlikely anyone would prevail, said Lluis Orriols, a professor in political science at the Carlos III University in Madrid. More likely would be another general election, Orriols said. Abascal, the leader of Vox, said in response to S\u00e1nchez\u2019s letter that S\u00e1nchez should have \u201cbenched himself long ago\u201d over the Catalan separatist amnesty deal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is another of his propaganda maneuvers to present himself as a poor victim,\u201d he said. Some on the street were also skeptical, saying the threat of resigning looked like a ploy by S\u00e1nchez. \u201cI think it\u2019s a way of attracting attention and getting the press to react, but the reality is that he\u2019s not going to resign,\u201d said Cristina, 24, a consultant in Madrid, declining to give a second name. Corruption scandals have dogged politics on the Iberian peninsula in recent years. Sanchez himself grabbed power after successfully leading a no confidence vote in 2018 against Mariano Rajoy of the PP after a court found party officials were guilty of operating a slush fund. In neighboring Portugal, Socialist Ant\u00f3nio Costa stepped down last year amid allegations of graft in hydrogen and lithium projects involving his government. S\u00e1nchez on Thursday had been scheduled to open the Socialist campaign for regional elections in Catalonia, where his party is seeking to wrest power from separatist parties that have led the region since 2015. Spain\u2019s Socialists are expected to be the strongest force in a weakening Socialists and Democrats group in European Parliament elections in June.",

          "raw_content": "Madrid, Apr 25 (EFE).- Prosecutors in Madrid on Thursday called for an alleged corruption inquiry into Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, the wife of Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to be dropped. The complaint was filed with a Madrid court on Wednesday by Manos Limpia (\u2018Clean Hands\u2019), a self-styled \u201cunion\u201d that was founded by a lawyer and former politician with ties to the Spanish far-right, although it insists it is politically independent. On Thursday, Manos Limpias admitted that the complaint was based on right-wing and far-right leaning news reports, the publishers of which would be responsible for the stories\u2019 accuracy. The complaint triggered S\u00e1nchez\u2019s shock announcement on Wednesday evening that he was suspending his public duties until Apr. 29 to \u201cstop and reflect\u201d on whether he wanted to remain in office given the \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cspurious\u201d claims being made against his wife. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office appealed against the decision taken by the court that admitted the Manos Limpias complaint, requesting that the ruling be revoked and the case archived. Prosecutors argue that there is no evidence of a crime that justifies the opening of criminal proceedings against S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, sources familiar with the case told EFE. The complaint by Manos Limpias accuses Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez of abusing her position to recommend or endorse entrepreneurs for public tenders. It also indicates that one of the business leaders who was awarded tenders of 10 million euros later organized a master\u2019s degree directed by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife at the Africa Center, of the Instituto de Empresa (\u2018Business Institute\u2019) study center. According to Manos Limpias, the Spanish airline Air Europa \u201cagreed to pay 40,000 euros a year to the Africa Center of the accused\u201d and that \u201cthe agreement between Globalia (which owns the airline) and the Instituto de Empresa included the delivery of 15,000 euros a year in first class flights for the accused and her team\u201d. In a press release on Thursday, the union\u2019s general secretary and founder, Miguel Bernad, said that when he saw that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office did not intend to take the case on as a matter of course, he decided to file a complaint so that a court \u201ccould verify the veracity of the allegations\u201d. He also insisted that he was exercising \u201ca right and a duty as a citizen\u201d, and that it is up to the judge to verify whether the news reports are true or not. In the statement, Bernad says S\u00e1nchez\u2019s letter on Wednesday night in which he labeled Manos Limpias as a \u201cfar-right-wing organization\u201d and implied that they are part of \u201ca right-wing campaign against him\u201d was \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Members of the left-wing coalition government and other left-wing political leaders have rallied round the prime minister. The conservative opposition People\u2019s Party and the far-right Vox, on the other hand, have accused the prime minister of \u201cplaying the victim\u201d. S\u00e1nchez has been accused by conservative and right-wing groups of undermining the Spanish state and rule of law by pardoning Catalan separatists who were charged with sedition over an independence referendum in 2017 in order to garner enough support to form the coalition government he leads. His decision to step back from his public duties comes against the backdrop of a complex political scenario in Spain, two weeks before the Catalan regional elections and ahead of the European Parliament elections in June. The Manos Limpias is a public sector employees\u2019 \u201cunion\u201d founded in 1995 by Miguel Bernad that has filed all kinds of complaints against what it considers to be political or economic corruption with harm to the general interest. Bernad was recently acquitted by the Supreme Court after being convicted by the Spanish National High Court for extorting money from banks and companies. The self-styled union put Infanta Cristina, sister of King Felipe VI, in the dock in 2016, in the trial against her then-husband, I\u00f1aki Urdangar\u00edn, for two crimes against the Public Treasury, of which she was acquitted. Manos Limpias was also involved in the indictment of Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, a judge who investigated alleged crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. EFE nac/ks",

          "content": "Madrid, Apr 25 (EFE).- Prosecutors in Madrid have called for the dismissal of a corruption inquiry into Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, wife of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.

          "raw_content": "From early in the morning, it was very evident that Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was affected by a judge\u2019s decision to open proceedings to investigate his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, in response to a complaint filed by the ultra-right group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), which specializes in filing complaints against left-wing leaders in cases which usually amount to nothing. S\u00e1nchez left Congress visibly upset, and went to La Moncloa, the seat of government in Spain. The leader of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) locked himself away with his family and drafted a letter stating that he is seriously considering resigning after the \u201cunprecedented attacks\u201d against his wife. \u201cI need to stop and reflect. I have to answer the question of whether it is worth it, whether I should continue at the head of the government or resign from this honor,\u201d the president said in a \u201cletter to citizens\u201d posted on the social network X, without an official letterhead \u2014 a sign that it is a personal matter. The prime minister sent the letter to his collaborators so that they could publish it, but he did not want to see anyone nor did he summon a crisis cabinet, as he did when he called early elections in 2023. S\u00e1nchez made the decision personally with his family, according to sources close to him. Practically nobody knew about it, and his main collaborators, a few hours before, were completely unaware of what was being forged. Shortly after the letter was made public, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s inner circle \u2014 Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, F\u00e9lix Bola\u00f1os, Santos Cerd\u00e1n, \u00d3scar Puente and \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez \u2014 met informally at La Moncloa to look for a solution, to try to convince the prime minister to continue, but all those who spoke to EL PA\u00cdS have said that it is an absolutely personal decision and that there is a human factor which is difficult to control. S\u00e1nchez has asked for time to think, and his entourage is determined to give him that time. Several officials in PSOE are considering organizing a large mobilization in support of the president and to reject the right-wing\u2019s methods of attack. Some believe that S\u00e1nchez, upon seeing the support, will change his mind and decide to remain in power. The prime minister recently expressed his support for other progressive politicians who have suffered the harassment of the far right, such as U.S. President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. He visited the two in Washington and Bras\u00edlia and told them that it was essential to unite to confront the \u201cinternational ultra-right.\u201d Many PSOE members who spoke to EL PA\u00cdS say that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s decision not to directly announce his resignation, but rather announce a time of reflection of a few days, is cause for hope. But nobody really knows what S\u00e1nchez \u2014 who has been at the helm of the Socialist Party for 10 years and still has another three years in office ahead of him \u2014 will do. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back is a case that La Moncloa says has no substance to it. It is the result of a complaint filed by an ultra-conservative group, whose leaders were sentenced to jail (and later acquitted) for extorting money from financial institutions. S\u00e1nchez has made it clear that attacks on his family take an especially hard toll on him. But he also recently told journalists that his opponents have thrown everything at him, but that he didn\u2019t care because he was resolved to continue. However, something changed this Wednesday, and for the first time in a political career built on resistance, which has always highlighted his strength of spirit and his unwavering faith in success, S\u00e1nchez announced that he is thinking of quitting. The leader of the PSOE said he is canceling his entire public agenda for a few days, until Monday, to reflect, talk to his family and make a decision. There is commotion in the government and in the PSOE, and both members of the executive and various party leaders have rushed to show their unconditional support for S\u00e1nchez on social media. Those close to the prime minister insist that it is not only a political issue, and that it is important to think about the human factor. Precisely two weeks ago, former Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero \u2014 another Socialist who was also severely attacked by the opposition when he was in power \u2014 told EL PA\u00cdS that he puts up with a lot, but S\u00e1nchez is tougher than him, arguing that this resilience was fundamental in a political scene as toxic as Spain\u2019s. But in this case, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s resilience appears not to have been enough. He received a very hard blow, and his reaction, to seriously consider resigning, is unprecedented. But the end of this story has not yet been written. The PSOE has a dramatic weekend ahead, in which members will do everything to convince their leader to continue. Because nobody has a plan B. The whole project is built around him and his resistance, the one that has always saved not only S\u00e1nchez but his league of supporters in the most difficult moments. Nobody thought that the leader could break. Now it is up to his people to turn around an unthinkable situation, a new twist in the crazy Spanish political scene, in which making forecasts is not only risky, but almost ridiculous, given its unpredictability.",

    "background_text": "The Fidesz-KDNP alliance has long been a dominant political force in Hungary, championed by Viktor Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP). Since 2005, they have secured a significant majority of Hungary's seats in the European Parliament, capitalizing on shared conservative and nationalistic ideologies. \n\nHowever, the alliance faces [new challenges](https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-eu-election-magyar-fidesz-russia-f53cd35e52a9f91c34b00d8dd6f85694) as P\u00e9ter Magyar, a former insider of the Fidesz party, breaks ranks and forms his own party, Tisztelet \u00e9s Szabads\u00e1g (Respect and Freedom). Magyar's emergence comes at a time when Fidesz is grappling with scandals and a loss of public trust, highlighted by significant resignations within its ranks.\n\nThe 2024 European Parliament elections are critical for the alliance as they face increasing internal and EU-wide challenges, including economic pressures and debates over the EU's influence on national policies. These elections will test the alliance's ability to maintain its influence amid growing political diversity and opposition within Hungary.",

Magyar's party is expected to gain a significant portion of the vote, which could directly impact Fidesz-KDNP's ability to maintain its plurality. However, Fidesz-KDNP's established political machinery and resources, along with the broader shift to the right in the EU, could mitigate these challenges.\n\nThe scandals and legal actions against Fidesz could erode public trust and voter support, but the party's historical resilience and ability to mobilize resources should not be underestimated. Additionally, nationalist sentiments could be galvanized by external pressures, potentially benefiting Fidesz-KDNP.\n\nBalancing these factors, the probability of Fidesz-KDNP maintaining its EU plurality is influenced by both internal challenges and external political dynamics. The emergence of a strong opposition and public discontent are significant, but the party's entrenched position and broader political trends provide countervailing forces.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.55</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the historical dominance of Fidesz-KDNP and their ability to navigate political challenges. While P\u00e9ter Magyar's new party poses a significant threat, the extent of its impact remains uncertain. The broader shift to the right in the EU and Fidesz-KDNP's established political infrastructure provide substantial support for maintaining their plurality.\n\nGiven the balance of these factors, the initial probability of 0.55 seems reasonable but slightly optimistic. Adjusting for potential overconfidence in the opposition's impact and considering the resilience of Fidesz-KDNP, a slight reduction in the probability is warranted.\n\nFinal probability: *0.52*\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.52*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "Summary The 2024 European Parliament elections will see a major shift to the right in many countries, with populist radical right parties gaining votes and seats across the EU, and centre-left and green parties losing votes and seats. Anti-European populists are likely to top the polls in nine member states (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia) and come second or third in a further nine countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). According to our forecast, almost half the seats will be held by MEPs outside the \u201csuper grand coalition\u201d of the three centrist groups. Inside the European Parliament, a populist right coalition of Christian democrats, conservatives, and radical right MEPs could emerge with a majority for the first time. This \u2018sharp right turn\u2019 is likely to have significant consequences for European-level policies, which will affect the foreign policy choices that the EU can make, particularly on environmental issues, where the new majority is likely to oppose ambitious EU action to tackle climate change. Far-right parties are becoming increasingly dominant in national settings across many EU capitals. Whether in election results, such as the success of Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party (PVV) in the Dutch general election in November, or in their ability to set the agenda from the opposition \u2013 such as the National Rally\u2019s support for France\u2019s regressive immigration bill in December \u2013 the far right played an important role in shaping European politics in 2023. 2024 is likely to see a continuation of this trend not only in national politics, but also at the European level, with early polls suggesting a more right-leaning European Parliament will emerge after the June 2024 European Parliament elections. To determine how significant this shift could be and the effect it could have on the European Union\u2019s policies and those of national governments, we collected the most recent opinion polls in every EU member state and applied a statistical model of the performance of national parties in previous European Parliament elections, building on a model we developed and used for the 2009, 2014, and 2019 elections. The results indicate that the European Parliament will likely take a sharp turn to the right after June 2024. While the parliament is not the most significant EU institution when it comes to foreign policy, the way in which the political groups align after the elections, and the impact that these elections have on national debates in member states, will have significant implications for the European Commission\u2019s and Council\u2019s ability to make foreign policy choices, most notably in implementing the next phase of the European Green Deal. Results Our model predicts the vote share that each national party will win in the 2024 European Parliament elections. From those vote shares we calculated how many seats each national party is likely to win, and how this could affect the political groups in the European Parliament. A full explanation of this model is given in the methodology section of this paper. The following graphic shows: current seats \u2013 the number of seats each political group currently has in the European Parliament; and projected seats \u2013 the number of seats each political group would win in June 2024 if each national party performed as predicted by our statistical model (taking into account that the number of MEPs will increase from 705 currently to 720 in June 2024). The results show that the two main political groups in the parliament \u2013 the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) \u2013 will likely continue to lose seats (they have lost seats in the last two European Parliament elections). This reflects the long-term decline in support for mainstream parties and the growing support for extremist and smaller parties across Europe, which is resulting in an increasing fragmentation of European party systems, at both the national and European levels. Despite this, we expect the EPP to remain the largest group in the parliament, and therefore maintain most agenda-setting power, including over the choice of the next commission president. We predict that the centrist Renew Europe (RE) group and the Greens/European Free Alliance (G/EFA) will also lose seats, falling from 101 to 86 and 71 to 61 respectively. Meanwhile, the Left group should increase their representation from 38 to 44 seats. In addition, if the Five Star Movement in Italy, which we predict will win 13 seats, decided not to sit with the non-attached (NI) MEPs, it may choose to join either the G/EFA or the Left, which would bolster the number of MEPs sitting to the left of the S&D. But the main winners in the elections will be the populist right. The major winner will be the radical right Identity and Democracy (ID) group, which we expect to gain 40 seats and, with almost 100 MEPs, to emerge as the third largest group in the new parliament. We also predict that the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group will gain 18 seats. And, if Fidesz in Hungary (which we expect to win 14 seats) decides to join the ECR rather than to sit with the non-attached MEPs, the ECR could overtake RE and ID and become the third largest group. We expect the ECR and ID groups together to account for 25 per cent of MEPs, and have more seats combined than the EPP or the S&D for the first time. Our model predicts significant seat losses for the EPP in Germany, Italy, Romania, and Ireland, but significant gains in Spain. We forecast that the S&D will lose a lot of seats in Germany, and the Netherlands, and will gain most seats in Poland. We expect RE to lose most seats in France and Spain, and to make most gains in the Czech Republic and Italy. We expect the ECR to pick up a lot of seats in Italy, as a result of Brothers of Italy (FdI) emerging as one of the largest delegations in the European Parliament (with 27 seats). With the expected fall of Forza Italia to only 7 seats, though, the EPP may approach Brothers of Italy to join their group. Our model predicts that the ECR will lose seats in Poland, and gain most seats in Romania and Spain, in addition to Italy. It predicts that ID will lose many seats in Italy, with the decline of Lega, but these losses will be offset by significant gains in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Bulgaria, and Austria. We expect the G/EFA to lose most seats in Germany, France, and Italy. Finally, our model predicts that the Left will make most gains in Germany, France, and Ireland. Naturally, there is some uncertainty in these predictions. In addition to the inevitable uncertainty of current opinion polls and our forecast of the likely vote shares and seats for each national party, there is also uncertainty regarding which political groups some parties will eventually join. The table below includes the parties whose group membership after the 2024 elections is uncertain. There are two types of uncertain parties: (1) those that are not currently represented in the parliament and are not currently members of a European political party (which would automatically determine their group membership); and (2) those that currently have MEPs but might join a different political group in the next parliament. We have already mentioned the three largest parties in this list: Fidesz from Hungary, and Brothers of Italy and the Five Star Movement from Italy. Beyond these, there are 25 other parties whose group membership remains uncertain. Together, we predict that these 28 parties will win 122 seats in June 2024, meaning that the eventual sizes of the groups might be somewhat different from those in our forecast. However, as the table shows, most of the uncertain parties are those that will sit to the right of the EPP, in either the ECR, ID, or as non-attached MEPs. As a result, our overall forecast about the balance of power in the parliament between the left and right, and the likely \u201csharp right turn\u201d is unlikely to change as a result of changes to these parties\u2019 current or expected group membership. Coalition patterns These changes will affect the sizes of the potential coalitions between the political groups in the chamber, which our analysis predicts will benefit the right. The \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of the EPP and the S&D, which lost a majority in the parliament for the first time in 2019, is set to lose seats, holding 42 per cent of the total, compared to its current 45 per cent. Even with the RE group, the \u201csuper grand coalition\u201d of the three centrist groups will only hold 54 per cent of the seats, compared to its current 60 per cent. With the average level of voting cohesion within groups in the European Parliament \u2013 which means that each group cannot always guarantee all their MEPs will follow the group voting instructions \u2013 54 per cent of the seats might not be enough for these three groups to guarantee a winning majority when they vote together. The left-right balance in the parliament will shift dramatically to the right. According to our model, the left coalition \u2013 of the S&D, the G/EFA, and the Left \u2013 will lose seats, with 33 per cent of the total, compared to the current 35 per cent. And, even if the left coalition can secure the support of RE \u2013 which they have done on environmental and social rights issues during the current term \u2013 it would hold only 45 per cent of the seats, compared to 50 per cent in the current parliament. By contrast, the size of the coalitions on the right is set to increase. A centre-right coalition \u2013 of the EPP, RE, and the ECR \u2013 will likely lose some seats, holding 48 per cent instead of the current 49 per cent. However, a \u201cpopulist right coalition\u201d \u2013 made up of the EPP, the ECR, and ID \u2013 will increase their share of the seats from 43 per cent to 49 per cent. In addition, the majority of the non-attached MEPs are from extreme right parties, meaning that with their support, majority coalitions could form to the right of RE for the first time in the history of the European Parliament. The \u201cpivotal MEP\u201d in the next parliament is likely to be in the EPP group, rather than in the centrist RE (or previously Liberal) group for the first time. Finally, our model predicts that the \u201cEU-critics\u201d on the radical right and radical left will increase dramatically to hold 37 per cent of the seats, compared to 30 per cent in the current parliament. In short, we expect that populist voices, particularly on the radical right, are likely to be louder after the 2024 elections than at any point since the European Parliament was first directly elected in 1979. Policy implications The changes to the political groups and coalitions will have consequences for the EU\u2019s policy agenda and the direction of future EU legislation. Coalitions on policy issues in the European Parliament tend not to be the result of formal agreements. Instead, political groups decide how to vote issue by issue. Nevertheless, we can use the voting patterns and winning coalition sizes in the current parliament to predict how far EU policies might change with the predicted group sizes and balance of power after the 2024 elections. Based on the analysis of recorded (roll-call) votes in the European Parliament collected by VoteWatch, different coalitions have tended to dominate in different policy areas in 2019-2024: A centrist grand coalition (EPP + S&D, usually also with RE) typically won on budgets, budgetary control, culture and education, economic and monetary affairs, foreign affairs, internal market and consumer protection, legal affairs, and transport and tourism. A centre + left coalition (S&D + RE+ G/EFA + the Left) usually won on civil liberties and justice and home affairs, development, employment and social affairs, environment, and women\u2019s rights and gender equality. A centre + right coalition (EPP + RE + ECR, and sometimes ID) usually won on agriculture and rural development, fisheries, industry and research, and international trade. Our research suggests that in most of these policy areas, these coalitions and winning",

          "raw_content": "Fri, 24th May 2024 The November 2024 US presidential election will be extremely close. Our forecast is a win for the Democratic incumbent, Joe Biden, but a victory for his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, cannot be discounted. The US is the EU\u2019s largest trade and investment partner, and European NATO members are reliant on US security guarantees, so the future of US trade and defence policy will be highly consequential for Europe. We expect a hawkish approach to China regardless of who wins the election, putting pressure on the EU to align. On green policy, Mr Trump would row back on global goals, but with some upside risks for European firms. The outlook for US security guarantees should Mr Trump retake the presidency is the issue causing the most consternation in Europe in the run-up to the US election. Mr Trump is often unpredictable, but his criticism of countries that do not meet NATO\u2019s target of defence spending amounting to 2% of GDP has been consistent. In recent comments he has taken his long-standing characterisation of these countries as \u201cfreeloaders\u201d to another level by suggesting that the US might not come to their aid in the event of a Russian invasion, as NATO\u2019s Article 5 requires. This has prompted much concern: in 2023, 20 of the 31 NATO members failed to meet the 2% spending target (although the countries bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine all did, bar Norway). Mr Trump has even floated the idea of the US withdrawing from NATO; however, this is highly unlikely, as it would need congressional approval. What we consider more likely from a Trump presidency is a spate of decisions aimed at putting severe pressure on European NATO members to step up their spending and become more autonomous in defence. This could include withdrawing from joint exercises, reducing the number of US troops on the ground, cutting relevant spending and continuing to sow doubts about the US\u2019s commitment to Article 5 of the alliance. In response, we would expect a more serious push in the EU towards boosting defence capabilities, including greater co-operation with the UK (where the defence spending target has recently been raised to 2.5% of GDP). Still, there are limitations to what could be achieved in the short to medium term given the degree of fragmentation in the current EU system, as well as bureaucratic and industrial bottlenecks. US military contractors stand to benefit most. Ukraine\u2019s future in the balance The most consequential security policy shift that we could expect from a Trump presidency concerns the level of US support for Ukraine. Under a Biden administration we would expect aid to be eroded to a level sufficient to stabilise the front lines, but not enough for Ukraine to regain the land currently occupied by Russia (about one-fifth of the country). Under Mr Trump uncertainty is high, but we would expect a sharper reduction in military and financial support in order to force Ukraine to the negotiating table to end the war quickly. The risk, depending on how this is handled, is that it could damage the credibility of the Western countries that had promised to back Ukraine, undermine Western security guarantees more generally and potentially embolden expansionist powers. Fear of Russian revisionism in the Baltic states and Moldova would spike in this scenario. NATO is already considering a plan to lock in \u20ac100bn of spending for Ukraine over five years. A potential shock to US-EU trade On trade policy, we would expect Mr Biden, for the most part, to co-operate with allies and compete with rivals. Mr Trump, in contrast, would probably prefer to compete with everyone, while also being less predictable and more antagonistic than Mr Biden. This is significant because the two economies are highly integrated: the US is the EU\u2019s largest trade partner (buying a fifth of EU exports in 2023) and its largest investment destination. The US also ran trade deficits\u2014which Mr Trump abhors\u2014with 20 of the 27 EU member states last year. In this context, Mr Trump\u2019s threat to impose a blanket 10% tariff on all of the US\u2019s trading partners represents a major potential shock to the EU economy. Of course, such a course of action would face both legal and congressional hurdles, so its feasibility remains far from clear\u2014and even if implemented, the EU might be able to secure exemptions. In the worst-case scenario, if tariffs were imposed and the EU retaliated with tariffs on US goods, this would be highly inflationary, damaging growth in both economies. We see three specific issues to watch on the US-EU trade policy front: US tariffs on EU steel (at 25%) and aluminium (at 10%) are currently suspended until 2025. Mr Biden would probably keep these suspended as leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Mr Trump would probably reimpose them immediately. This would exacerbate the EU\u2019s decline in global market share for such energy-intensive goods, after an initial hit when European gas prices spiked in 2022. US tariffs on automotive imports were a threat during Mr Trump\u2019s first presidency, and, although they were not imposed by the necessary deadline in 2019, could make a reappearance should he win a second term. EU carmakers would be vulnerable. Plans for digital services taxes (DSTs) are currently on hold during negotiations on the OECD\u2019s global tax deal. We expect that Mr Biden would keep the US involved in this, even though he might not finally endorse the treaty. In contrast, Mr Trump would probably exit the agreement\u2014prompting the suspended DSTs to be imposed. These would be most damaging for US tech firms, and could prompt a tit-for-tat trade war. Industrial policy: green subsidies and China de-risking On climate policy, a win for Mr Trump would mean a significant shift in the US stance. Mr Biden and Mr Trump have opposing views on climate change, with Mr Biden prioritising investment in green technologies and renewable energy in the almost US$400bn Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while Mr Trump has promised to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the international climate change treaty, and invest in fossil fuels. There would be upside risks for investment in Europe from Mr Trump\u2019s plans to slow down IRA subsidies for investments in renewable energies, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), as these have been drawing investment away from European firms. However, the bigger picture is that for the EU, losing the US as an ally in the fight against climate change would be a severe hit, as this would be likely to jeopardise global efforts to avoid a tipping point in temperatures. It could also embolden those in the EU pushing for short-term economic interests to be prioritised over the green transition. On China, both candidates agree (roughly speaking) on a hawkish position, with Mr Biden announcing 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs in May. Under either president, European countries will come under pressure to clarify and harden their positions on China, with the current disunity (Germany versus France, and Hungary versus the rest of the EU) creating friction in the US-EU relationship. The shape of this would vary, though, with Mr Biden pushing for a multilateral position (painful for Europe given its greater economic exposure to China), and Mr Trump\u2019s unilateral decision-making presenting unpredictable risks (such as Chinese goods flooding into the EU as a result of new tariffs on exports to the US). In particular, Mr Trump\u2019s threat to revoke China\u2019s \u201cmost-favoured nation\u201d status and raise tariffs on all Chinese goods by up to 60% would have major repercussions for Europe. We see two specific issues to watch on the industrial policy front: The EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is now being phased in, with duties to be levied from 2026. For Mr Trump, this would be an automatic point of contention with the EU\u2014even though the US will not be much disadvantaged by this, as its production of the goods affected is not highly carbon-intensive. It might even benefit, with its exports being taxed less than emerging market equivalents. Co-operation on diversifying suppliers of critical minerals would continue under Mr Biden, probably through the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC), where this has already begun. Under Mr Trump the TTC would probably not survive. However, shared US and EU progress on de-risking critical mineral supply chains away from China could potentially be achieved on a transactional rather than a co-operative basis.",

The European Union executive said on Wednesday that it has sent a formal notice to Budapest informing it that the legislation violates the bloc\u2019s democratic values and fundamental rights. Opponents of Prime Minster Viktor Orban\u2019s authoritarian regime claim the new laws threaten to stifle his political rivals, as well as critical media and civil society. The Commission has been at loggerheads with Orban for years over Hungary\u2019s rule of law, and more recently over his efforts to block aid to Ukraine. It was widely expected to launch such an infringement procedure after the laws were passed by the Hungarian parliament, dominated by the ruling Fidesz party, in December. The nationalist Orban insists that the legislation, which clamps down on the foreign funding of political candidates, as well as any body or individual with influence over public discourse, is vital to curb foreign influence. Political candidates violating the rules on funding will face up to three years in prison. The newly established Office for the Defence of Sovereignty, led by a government appointee, has the power to probe recipients of foreign funding. It can demand public and private information from targets, as well as Hungary\u2019s intelligence services. Critics warn that the laws, viewed as similar to draconian laws implemented by President Vladimir Putin in Russia, hand Orban the power to set the security services on opponents and critics. Chilling effect The Commission said that the law violates a wide range of fundamental values, including the principle of democracy, the right to privacy, protection of personal data, freedom of expression, information and association, and the right to a fair trial, among others. \u201cThe setup of a new authority with wide-ranging powers and a strict regime of monitoring, enforcement and sanctioning also risks to seriously harm democracy,\u201d a Commission spokesperson said. Hungary will have two months to respond. The letter of formal notice is the first step under the EU\u2019s infringement procedure, which can lead to a lawsuit in the EU\u2019s Court of Justice and potentially fines. The United States has previously warned that the law offers the government \u201cdraconian tools that can be used to intimidate and punish those with views not shared by the ruling party\u201d. Analysts tell Al Jazeera that the EU will very likely force Orban to scrap the legislation eventually but warn that, in the meantime, it will have a chilling effect on the political opposition, independent media and civil society.",

          "raw_content": "By Aleks Szczerbiak One would expect the newly elected governing parties to do well, and the recently defeated right-wing opposition to struggle, in local elections held in the aftermath of last October\u2019s parliamentary election. But with the first serious conflicts emerging within the ruling coalition, the respective vote shares secured by the eclectic agrarian-liberal centrist Third Way (Trzecia Droga) and the radical right could be pivotal in determining a number of closely fought regional elections. First test for the new government On 7 April, Poles will vote for thousands of councillors and local mayors in parish, county and regional elections, with second-round run-offs two weeks later where no mayoral candidate has secured more than 50% of the vote. These local elections were scheduled for last autumn but postponed for half a year, officially to avoid a clash with last October\u2019s parliamentary poll. Although they have been extremely low key, as the first major test of public opinion since the parliamentary election that ended eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, they will be one of the most important political events of the year. Last December, a new coalition government led by Donald Tusk, who had served as prime minister in 2007-14 and then European Council president in 2014-19, was sworn in. Tusk is leader of the liberal-centrist Civic Platform (PO) which, after an eight-year interlude in opposition, once again became the country\u2019s main governing party. The new coalition also includes the Third Way alliance \u2013 which itself comprises the agrarian-centrist Polish People\u2019s Party (PSL), and the liberal-centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050) grouping formed to capitalise on TV personality-turned-politician Szymon Ho\u0142ownia\u2019s strong third place in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 and the smaller New Left (Nowa Lewica) party, the main component of a broader Left (Lewica) electoral alliance. Last November, Ho\u0142ownia was also elected to the high-profile post of speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower parliamentary chamber, which he is using to promote himself in anticipation of a summer 2025 presidential bid. Tough challenge for PiS The local elections will be a particularly tough challenge for PiS. Parties that have recently lost an election often perform badly in so-called \u201csecond order\u201d polls held in its immediate aftermath, because their demoralised supporters are much less likely to turn out and vote. According to the Politico Europe aggregator of Polish opinion polls, PiS is currently averaging around 30% support compared with 35% in the parliamentary election. A second consecutive election defeat would exacerbate the already-deep internal divisions within the party and further de-motivate its activists ahead of the June European Parliament poll, the next critical electoral test. Local elections have always been difficult ones for PiS because much of the media focus goes on the high-profile mayoral contests in Poland\u2019s larger towns and cities where the party has no prospect of winning. In fact, as the only local government tier contested mainly on national party lines, the aggregated vote share in elections to the 16 regional authorities is the key barometer of party support. Regional councils also play an important role in distributing EU funds and are a key source of local party patronage. In the previous 2018 local elections, PiS won 34% of the vote at this tier with an outright majority in six authorities, and secured control of a further two thanks to a defection in one and a coalition with non-party independents in another. However, because PiS has weak coalition potential if the party does not win outright majorities it will struggle to find partners to retain control of these authorities, even it if remains the largest party. In 2014, for example, PiS won the most seats in six regional assemblies but only ended up controlling one, its Podkarpacie stronghold. This time, PiS will do very well to retain control of even three regions. Its only realistic potential local coalition partner is the radical-right Confederation (Konfederacja) party, which is fighting the elections on a joint list with non-party independents. However, Confederation is not an especially reliable partner and will struggle anyway to secure representation in many assemblies. Although the formal electoral threshold is 5%, given the size of the polling districts parties need to win around 10% to secure representation, ideally nearer 12% to be sure. Confederation\u2019s 7% in October\u2019s parliamentary election was extremely disappointing; at one point polls suggested that it could secure well over 10% and emerge as the \u201ckingmaker\u201d in the new parliament. However, it appears to have recovered some ground and, according to Politico Europe, is currently averaging around 10% again. First serious conflicts within the governing coalition One would also expect the parties that were victorious in last October\u2019s parliamentary poll to still be enjoying a post-election honeymoon and do well in local elections held so soon after their victory. Sure enough, Politico Europe shows that, for the first time in years, PO has overtaken PiS in the polls with 33% support. However, at the same time, the first serious conflicts have also started to emerge within the governing coalition. First, PO suddenly rejected the idea of standing a joint candidates list with The Left for the regional assemblies, no doubt more confident that it could defeat PiS single-handedly. Given the de facto 10% electoral threshold, this is a problem for The Left, which is averaging around 9% support in the polls (roughly the same as it secured last October). PO\u2019s unexpected move meant that, in order to raise its profile, The Left had to find ways of differentiating itself from its governing partners, which it did by focusing on the highly contentious and divisive issue of abortion. In Polish politics, the terms \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d refer more to attitudes towards moral-cultural questions than socioeconomic policy, and abortion has become one of The Left\u2019s signature issues. Moreover, many commentators felt that the huge protests against the Polish Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s October 2020 ruling, that abortions on the grounds of serious and irreversible birth defects are unconstitutional, was a key turning point in the previous PiS government\u2019s slump in support from which it never really recovered and which culminated in its election defeat. As a consequence, the abortion issue has assumed huge symbolic importance for many of the new government\u2019s supporters who hoped that it would introduce legislative changes to expand access to it. However, although there is broad consensus within the ruling coalition that the tribunal\u2019s ruling should be reversed, it is very divided on what precise form that should take. Both PO and The Left have proposed bills that would not only reverse the near-total ban but go even further liberalising the law to allow abortion, more-or-less on demand, up to the twelfth week of pregnancy. But the Third Way wants a return to the much more restrictive so-called abortion \u201ccompromise\u201d that existed before the tribunal ruling, together with a national referendum on the issue. PSL\u2019s moderate social conservatism on moral-cultural issues reflects its predominantly rural and small-town electoral base, while Ho\u0142ownia is a practising Catholic (albeit a very liberal one) who has expressed opposition to abortion on demand in the past. A new phase of confrontation over this issue began when Ho\u0142ownia announced that parliamentary work on legislation aimed at liberalising the abortion law would not begin until after the first round of voting in the local elections. He argued that this was necessary to avoid the legislation becoming a victim of the ongoing election campaign because, he claimed, if parliament proceeded with the various abortion bills before polling day there was a danger that both sides would feel under pressure to take tough positions and all of them would be rejected. Ho\u0142ownia\u2019s announcement was, however, met with anger from The Left, which claimed that he was delaying the debate because some Third Way election candidates, especially those standing for PSL, were afraid of offending local parish priests who remain influential civil society actors in smaller towns and rural areas. Is the Third Way losing support? Interestingly, in a swipe at his coalition partners, Tusk called upon PO supporters who had voted tactically for the Third Way in the parliamentary election to return to the fold and vote in line with their beliefs in these local polls. In fact, having seen a post-election bounce in support, the Third Way seems to be slipping back to around, or even a little below, the 14% that it achieved last October. PSL always performs much better in local elections due to its strong grassroots organisational base together with the fact that turnout in the rural areas that form the bedrock of its support is always higher in these polls. But Poland 2050 will find it more difficult given that it lacks a local membership base. Consequently, the Third Way has also been trying to find ways of shoring up its support, particularly among the business community, by making changing the calculation of health insurance premiums for entrepreneurs a condition of it remaining in the governing coalition. In the event, PO finance minister Andrzej Doma\u0144ski announced a partial reform but which The Left has criticised for mainly benefiting the better-off. In raising this issue, the Third Way was no doubt conscious that some of the entrepreneurs who voted for it last October had at one point intended to support Confederation, and that these voters could switch back. Indeed, in a number of current PiS-run regional assemblies, the election is on a knife edge and the Third Way and Confederation\u2019s respective vote shares could determine who ends up controlling them. Even the election of a single Confederation councillor could prove pivotal in some regions. A dry-run for the next presidential election? The most prestigious and high-profile local poll is the Warsaw mayoral election. PO incumbent Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski \u2013 who narrowly lost the 2020 Polish presidential election, and is seen by many commentators as the party\u2019s most likely candidate in the 2025 race \u2013 remains the undisputed favourite. However, the scale of Trzaskowski\u2019s victory will also be important and anything less than a repeat of his decisive 2018 first-round victory will be seen as a disappointment. PiS are standing the former regional governor of Mazovia, which encompasses Warsaw, Tobiasz Boche\u0144ski who is very presentable but has no chance of winning. Notwithstanding the fact that he is a political unknown and PiS is on the defensive, as is the case with most Polish cities Warsaw is a liberal-left heartland. In fact, Boche\u0144ski\u2019s candidacy is seen as a way of building his national profile ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election, presumably to repeat PiS\u2019s manoeuvre of selecting a fresh face, which worked so well in 2015 when current party-backed President Andrzej Duda won a shock victory over the PO-backed incumbent. So a good result for Mr Boche\u0144ski would be securing around 30% and forcing Trzaszkowski into a run-off. This time, Trzaskowski also faces a more significant challenge on his left flank from Magdalena Biejat from the radical-left Together (Razem) party (part of The Left electoral alliance but not the governing coalition), who represents the Warsaw district in the Senate, Poland\u2019s less powerful second parliamentary chamber. It is in Trzaszkowski\u2019s interests to downplay Biejat\u2019s prospects and talk up Boche\u0144ski\u2019s, because such a polarising dynamic increases his chances of consolidating and mobilising the anti-PiS vote around his candidacy, as he did so successfully last time around. Interestingly, the Third Way has decided to back Trzaskowski rather than stand their own candidate which, given that he is one of Ho\u0142ownia\u2019s main presidential election rivals, may prove to be a major strategic error.

    "background_text": "On June 4, 2024, a group of current and former employees at frontier AI labs called for \"[sweeping changes to the artificial intelligence industry, including greater transparency and protections for whistle-blowers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/technology/openai-culture-whistleblowers.html?unlocked_article_code=1.xE0._mTr.aNO4f_hEp2J4&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=c-cb).\"\n\nIn a public statement titled \"[A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence](https://righttowarn.ai/),\" the group said:\n\n> We are current and former employees at frontier AI companies, and we believe in the potential of AI technology to deliver unprecedented benefits to humanity.\n\n> We also understand the serious risks posed by these technologies. These risks range from the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction. AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].\n\n> We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry. We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.\n\n> **We therefore call upon advanced AI companies to commit to these principles.**\n\n> 1. **That the company will not enter into or enforce** any agreement that prohibits \u201cdisparagement\u201d or criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, nor retaliate for risk-related criticism by hindering any vested economic benefit;\n2. **That the company will facilitate a verifiably anonymous process** for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise;\n3. **That the company will support a culture of open criticism** and allow its current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns about its technologies to the public, to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, or to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise, so long as trade secrets and other intellectual property interests are appropriately protected;\n4. **That the company will not retaliate against current and former employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.** We accept that any effort to report risk-related concerns should avoid releasing confidential information unnecessarily. Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially. However, as long as such a process does not exist, current and former employees should retain their freedom to report their concerns to the public.",

      "<facts>\n1. On June 4, 2024, a group of current and former employees from OpenAI and other AI companies issued a letter calling for greater transparency and protections for whistle-blowers.\n2.

However, the public pressure and recent steps taken by OpenAI to address transparency and safety concerns indicate a potential for further commitments.\n\nGiven the recent policy changes and the establishment of a Safety and Security Committee, it seems plausible that OpenAI is moving in the direction of adopting more robust whistleblower protections. However, the complexity of implementing a verifiably anonymous process and the potential resistance from within the company may delay this commitment.\n\nOverall, the factors supporting a \"yes\" answer are strong but not overwhelming, and the logistical and commercial challenges present significant hurdles. Therefore, the probability of OpenAI publicly committing to an anonymous process to raise risks as part of the \"right to warn\" principles before July 1, 2024, is moderate.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.55</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, I consider the base rate of companies making significant policy changes under public pressure. While OpenAI has shown some willingness to adapt, the specific requirement of a verifiably anonymous process adds complexity. The recent policy changes and the establishment of a Safety and Security Committee are positive indicators, but they do not guarantee a full commitment to the proposed principles within the given timeframe.\n\nGiven the moderate probability and the factors involved, I believe the initial forecast is reasonable. However, I will slightly adjust the probability to account for the potential delays and internal resistance that may arise.\n\nFinal probability: 0.50\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.50*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "A handful of current and former employees at OpenAI and other prominent artificial intelligence companies warned that the technology poses grave risks to humanity in a Tuesday letter, calling on companies to implement sweeping changes to ensure transparency and foster a culture of public debate. The letter, signed by 13 people including current and former employees at Anthropic and Google\u2019s DeepMind, said AI can exacerbate inequality, increase misinformation, and allow AI systems to become autonomous and cause significant death. Though these risks could be mitigated, corporations in control of the software have \u201cstrong financial incentives\u201d to limit oversight, they said. Because AI is only loosely regulated, accountability rests on company insiders, the employees wrote, calling on corporations to lift nondisclosure agreements and give workers protections that allow them to anonymously raise concerns. Advertisement The move comes as OpenAI faces a staff exodus. Many critics have seen prominent departures \u2014 including of OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and senior researcher Jan Leike \u2014 as a rebuke of company leaders, who some employees argue chase profit at the expense of making OpenAI\u2019s technologies safer. Daniel Kokotajlo, a former employee at OpenAI, said he left the start-up because of the company\u2019s disregard for the risks of artificial intelligence. \u201cI lost hope that they would act responsibly, particularly as they pursue artificial general intelligence,\u201d he said in a statement, referencing a hotly contested term referring to computers matching the power of human brains. \u201cThey and others have bought into the \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 approach, and that is the opposite of what is needed for technology this powerful and this poorly understood,\u201d Kokotajlo said. Advertisement Liz Bourgeois, a spokesperson at OpenAI, said the company agrees that \u201crigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology.\u201d Representatives from Anthropic and Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The employees said that absent government oversight, AI workers are the \u201cfew people\u201d who can hold corporations accountable. They said that they are hamstrung by \u201cbroad confidentiality agreements\u201d and that ordinary whistleblower protections are \u201cinsufficient\u201d because they focus on illegal activity, and the risks that they are warning about are not yet regulated. The letter called for AI companies to commit to four principles to allow for greater transparency and whistleblower protections. Those principles are a commitment to not enter into or enforce agreements that prohibit criticism of risks; a call to establish an anonymous process for current and former employees to raise concerns; supporting a culture of criticism; and a promise to not retaliate against current and former employees who share confidential information to raise alarms \u201cafter other processes have failed.\u201d Advertisement The Washington Post in December reported that senior leaders at OpenAI raised fears about retaliation from CEO Sam Altman \u2014 warnings that preceded the chief\u2019s temporary ouster. In a recent podcast interview, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner said part of the nonprofit\u2019s decision to remove Altman as CEO late last year was his lack of candid communication about safety. \u201cHe gave us inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place, meaning that it was basically just impossible for the board to know how well those safety processes were working,\u201d she told \u201cThe TED AI Show\u201d in May. The letter was endorsed by AI luminaries including Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who are considered \u201cgodfathers\u201d of AI, and renowned computer scientist Stuart Russell.",

          "raw_content": "A group of former and current OpenAI staffers wants to ensure that employees can publicly disclose the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday, the group of 13 workers published an open letter arguing that AI companies \u201chave strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,\u201d including whether their technologies might cause societal upheaval. \u201cThey currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society,\u201d the staffers wrote. \u201cWe do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\u201d In response, the workers are calling on AI companies to commit to four principles designed to give their employees a way to notify the public about such dangers if they were ever to arise. Importantly, the first principle would require AI companies to refrain from using contractual agreements to punish employees for speaking out about AI risks. Seven former OpenAI employees signed the letter, along with four anonymous current staffers. The two other signees include a former Google DeepMind researcher and a current DeepMind staffer. In addition, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton endorsed the document. The open letter comes a few weeks after OpenAI was criticized for forcing employees to sign NDAs that prevented departing workers from disparaging the company for life. If they did, they'd lose their vested equity. OpenAI later said it ditched the policy after CEO Sam Altman claimed: \u201cI did not know this was happening and I should have.\u201d Ex-employees allege that OpenAI\u2019s leadership was fully aware of the NDA policy. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning that they engaged in these intimidation tactics for so long and only course-corrected under public pressure,\u201d tweeted Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI employee who signed the open letter. \u201cIt\u2019s also concerning that leaders who signed off on these policies claim they didn\u2019t know about them.\u201d The open letter goes on to say it\u2019s crucial that employees at today's AI companies can warn the public about potential dangers, especially since \u201cno effective government oversight of these corporations\u201d is currently in place. As a result, the group is calling on AI companies to facilitate an anonymous process for workers to raise AI risk concerns with corporate boards, regulators, and independent organizations. Two other principles also demand that AI companies \u201csupport a culture of open criticism\u201d and refrain from punishing employees for publicly sharing \u201crisk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.\u201d OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. But last week, the company announced it was forming a new \"Safety and Security Committee\" meant to oversee future AI projects after the previous leaders of OpenAI\u2019s long-term safety team resigned. Altman will lead the new committee alongside OpenAI Board Chairman Bret Taylor, co-creator of Google Maps, and Nicole Seligman, general counsel for Sony. The same committee will also take input from third-party experts, such as former NSA Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce and former US Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin. UPDATE: OpenAI sent PCMag the following statement: \"We\u2019re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we'll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.\" Along with supporting further government regulation, the company notes that it maintains a hotline for OpenAI employees and contractors to raise concerns, including possible policy violations. In addition, OpenAI says it won't release a new technology until the necessary safeguards have been created.",

They also called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as the law struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. Companies have acknowledged the \u201cserious risks\u201d posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control, known as \u201csingularity,\u201d that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but they should be be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures, the group wrote. As the law currently stands, the AI employees said, they don\u2019t believe AI companies will share critical information about the technology voluntarily. It\u2019s essential, then, for current and former employees to speak up \u2014 and for companies not to enforce \u201cdisparagement\u201d agreements or otherwise retaliate against those who voice risk-related concerns. \u201cOrdinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated,\u201d the group wrote. Their letter comes as companies move quickly to implement generative AI tools into their products, while government regulators, companies and consumers grapple with responsible use. Meanwhile many tech experts, researchers and leaders have called for a temporary pause in the AI race, or for the government to step in and create a moratorium. OpenAI\u2019s response In response to the letter, OpenAI spokesperson told CNN it is \u201cproud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk, adding that the company agrees \u201crigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology.\u201d OpenAI noted it has an anonymous integrity hotline and a Safety and Security Committee led by members of its board and safety leaders from the company. The company does not sell personal info, build user profiles, or use that data to target anyone or sell anything. But Daniel Ziegler, one of the organizers behind the letter and an early machine-learning engineer who worked at OpenAI between 2018 and 2021, told CNN that it\u2019s important to remain skeptical of the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell from the outside how seriously they\u2019re taking their commitments for safety evaluations and figuring out societal harms, especially as there is such strong commercial pressures to move very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have the right culture and processes so that employees can speak out in targeted ways when they have concerns.\u201d He hopes more professionals in the AI industry will go public with their concerns as a result of the letter. Meanwhile, Apple is widely expected to announce a partnership with OpenAI at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference to bring generative AI to the iPhone.",

          "raw_content": "Eleven current and former employees of OpenAI, along with two more from Google DeepMind, posted an open letter today stating that they are unable to voice concerns about risks created by their employees due to confidentiality agreements. Today let\u2019s talk about what they said, what they left out, and why lately the AI safety conversation feels like it\u2019s going nowhere. Here\u2019s a dynamic we\u2019ve seen play out a few times now at companies including Meta, Google, and Twitter. First, in a bid to address potential harms created by their platforms, companies hire idealistic workers and charge them with building safeguards into their systems. For a while, the work of these teams gets prioritized. But over time, executives\u2019 enthusiasm wanes, commercial incentives take over, and the team is gradually de-funded. When those roadblocks go up, some of the idealistic employees will speak out, either to a reporter like me, or via the sort of open letter that the AI workers published today. And the company responds by reorganizing the team out of existence, while putting out a statement saying that whatever that team used to work on is now everyone\u2019s responsibility. At Meta, this process gave us the whistleblower Frances Haugen. On Google\u2019s AI ethics team, a slightly different version of the story played out after the firing of researcher Timnit Gebru. And in 2024, the story came to the AI industry. OpenAI arguably set itself up for this moment more than those other tech giants. After all, it was established not as a traditional for-profit enterprise, but as a nonprofit research lab devoted to safely building an artificial general intelligence. OpenAI\u2019s status as a relatively obscure nonprofit changed forever in November 2022. That\u2019s when it released ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the latest version of its large language model, which by some estimates soon became the fastest-growing consumer product in history. ChatGPT took a technology that had been exclusively the province of nerds and put it in the hands of everyone from elementary school children to state-backed foreign influence operations. And OpenAI soon barely resembled the nonprofit that was founded out of a fear that AI poses an existential risk to humanity. This OpenAI placed a premium on speed. It pushed the frontier forward with tools like plugins, which connected ChatGPT to the wider internet. It aggressively courted developers. Less than a year after ChatGPT\u2019s release, the company \u2014 a for-profit subsidiary of its nonprofit parent \u2014 was valued at $90 billion. That transformation, led by CEO Sam Altman, gave many in the company whiplash. And it was at the heart of the tensions that led the nonprofit board to fire Altman last year, for reasons related to governance. The five-day interregnum between Altman\u2019s firing and his return marked a pivotal moment for the company. The board could have recommitted to its original vision of slow, cautious development of powerful AI systems. Or it could endorse the post-ChatGPT version of OpenAI, which closely resembled a traditional Silicon Valley venture-backed startup. Almost immediately, it became clear that a vast majority of employees preferred working at a more traditional startup. Among other things, that startup\u2019s commercial prospects meant that their (unusual) equity in the company would be worth millions of dollars. The vast majority of OpenAI employees threatened to quit if Altman didn\u2019t return. And so Altman returned. Most of the old board left. New, more business-minded board members replaced them. And that board has stood by Altman in the months that followed, even as questions mount about his complex business dealings and conflicts of interest. Most employees seem content under the new regime; positions at OpenAI are still highly sought after. But like Meta and Google before it, OpenAI had its share of conscientious objectors. And increasingly, we\u2019re hearing what they think. The latest wave began last month when OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who initially backed Altman\u2019s firing and who had focused on AI safety efforts, quit the company. He was followed out the door by Jan Leike, who led the superalignment team, and a handful of other employees who worked on safety. Then on Tuesday a new group of whistleblowers came forward to complain. Here\u2019s handsome podcaster Kevin Roose in the New York Times: The members say OpenAI, which started as a nonprofit research lab and burst into public view with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, is putting a priority on profits and growth as it tries to build artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., the industry term for a computer program capable of doing anything a human can. They also claim that OpenAI has used hardball tactics to prevent workers from voicing their concerns about the technology, including restrictive nondisparagement agreements that departing employees were asked to sign. \u201cOpenAI is really excited about building A.G.I., and they are recklessly racing to be the first there,\u201d said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former researcher in OpenAI\u2019s governance division and one of the group\u2019s organizers. Anyone looking for jaw-dropping allegations from the whistleblowers will likely leave disappointed. Kokotajlo\u2019s sole specific complaint in the article is that \u201csome employees believed\u201d Microsoft had released a new version of GPT-4 in Bing without proper testing; Microsoft denies that this happened. But the accompanying letter offers one possible explanation for why the charges feel so thin: employees are forbidden from saying more by various agreements they signed as a condition of working at the company. (The company has said it is removing some of the more onerous language from its agreements, after Vox reported on them last month.) \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest A.I. systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk,\u201d an OpenAI spokeswoman told the Times. \u201cWe agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology, and we\u2019ll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.\u201d The company also created a whistleblower hotline for employees to anonymously voice their concerns. So how should we think about this letter? I imagine that it will be a Rorschach test for whoever reads it, and what they see will depend on what they think of the AI safety movement in general. For those who believe that AI poses existential risk, I imagine this letter will provide welcome evidence that at least some employees inside the big AI makers are taking those risks seriously. And for those who don\u2019t, I imagine it will provide more ammunition for the argument that the AI doomers are once again warning about dire outcomes without providing any compelling evidence for their beliefs. As a journalist, I find myself naturally sympathetic to people inside companies who warn about problems that haven\u2019t happened yet. Journalism often serves a similar purpose, and every once in a while, it can help prevent those problems from occurring. (This can often make the reporter look foolish, since they spent all that time warning about a scenario that never unfolded, but that\u2019s a subject for another day.) At the same time, there\u2019s no doubt that the AI safety argument has begun to feel a bit tedious over the past year, when the harms caused by large language models have been funnier than they have been terrifying. Last week, when OpenAI put out the first account of how its products are being used in covert influence operations, there simply wasn\u2019t much there to report. We\u2019ve seen plenty of problematic misuse of AI, particularly deepfakes in elections and in schools. (And of women in general.) And yet people who sign letters like the one released today fail to connect high-level hand-wringing about their companies to the products and policy decisions that their companies make. Instead, they speak through opaque open letters that have surprisingly little to say about what safe development might actually look like in practice. For a more complete view of the problem, I preferred another (and much longer) piece of writing that came out Tuesday. Leopold Aschenbrenner, who worked on OpenAI\u2019s superalignment team and was reportedly fired for leaking in April, published a 165-page paper today laying out a path from GPT-4 to superintelligence, the dangers it poses, and the challenge of aligning that intelligence with human intentions. We\u2019ve heard a lot of this before, and the hypotheses remain as untestable (for now) as they always have. But I find it difficult to read the paper and not come away believing that AI companies ought to prioritize alignment research, and that current and former employees ought to be able to talk about the risks they are seeing. \u201cNavigating these perils will require good people bringing a level of seriousness to the table that has not yet been offered,\u201d Aschenbrenner concludes. \u201cAs the acceleration intensifies, I only expect the discourse to get more shrill. But my greatest hope is that there will be those who feel the weight of what is coming, and take it as a solemn call to duty.\u201d And if those who feel the weight of what is coming work for an AI company, it seems important that they be able to talk about what they\u2019re seeing now, and in the open.

          "raw_content": "On Tuesday, a group of former OpenAI and Google DeepMind employees published an open letter calling for AI companies to commit to principles allowing employees to raise concerns about AI risks without fear of retaliation. The letter, titled \"A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence,\" has so far been signed by 13 individuals, including some who chose to remain anonymous due to concerns about potential repercussions. The signatories argue that while AI has the potential to deliver benefits to humanity, it also poses serious risks that include \"further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction.\" They also assert that AI companies possess substantial non-public information about their systems' capabilities, limitations, and risk levels, but currently have only weak obligations to share this information with governments and none with civil society. Non-anonymous signatories to the letter include former OpenAI employees Jacob Hilton, Daniel Kokotajlo, William Saunders, Carroll Wainwright, and Daniel Ziegler, as well as former Google DeepMind employees Ramana Kumar and Neel Nanda. The group calls upon AI companies to commit to four key principles: not enforcing agreements that prohibit criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, facilitating an anonymous process for employees to raise concerns, supporting a culture of open criticism, and not retaliating against employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed. In May, a Vox article by Kelsey Piper raised concerns about OpenAI's use of restrictive non-disclosure agreements for departing employees, which threatened to revoke vested equity if former employees criticized the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to the allegations, stating that the company had never clawed back vested equity and would not do so if employees declined to sign the separation agreement or non-disparagement clause. But critics remained unsatisfied, and OpenAI soon did a public about-face on the issue, saying it would remove the non-disparagement clause and equity clawback provisions from its separation agreements, acknowledging that such terms were inappropriate and contrary to the company's stated values of transparency and accountability. That move from OpenAI is likely what made the current open letter possible. Dr. Margaret Mitchell, an AI ethics researcher at Hugging Face who was fired from Google in 2021 after raising concerns about diversity and censorship within the company, spoke with Ars Technica about the challenges faced by whistleblowers in the tech industry. \"Theoretically, you cannot be legally retaliated against for whistleblowing. In practice, it seems that you can,\" Mitchell stated. \"Laws support the goals of large companies at the expense of workers. They are not in workers' favor.\" Mitchell highlighted the psychological toll of pursuing justice against a large corporation, saying, \"You essentially have to give up your career and your psychological health to pursue justice against an organization that, by virtue of being a company, does not have feelings and does have the resources to destroy you.\" She added, \"Remember that it is incumbent upon you, the fired person, to make the case that you were retaliated against\u2014a single person, with no source of income after being fired\u2014against a trillion-dollar corporation with an army of lawyers who specialize in harming workers in exactly this way.\" The open letter has garnered support from distinguished AI experts, including Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton (who has warned about AI in the past), and Stuart J. Russell. It's worth noting that other experts like Meta's Yann LeCun have taken issue with claims that AI poses an existential risk to humanity, and other experts feel like the \"AI takeover\" talking point is a distraction from current AI harms like bias and dangerous hallucinations. Even with the disagreement over what precise harms may come from AI, Mitchell feels the concerns raised by the letter underscore the urgent need for greater transparency, oversight, and protection for employees who speak out about potential risks: \"While I appreciate and agree with this letter,\" she says, \"there needs to be significant changes in the laws that disproportionately support unjust practices from large corporations at the expense of workers doing the right thing.\"",

          "raw_content": "AI, according to the open letter, has the power \u201cto deliver unprecedented benefits to humanity,\u201d but only if it\u2019s developed with adequate guardrails \u2013 along with reliable channels of communication through which individuals with insider knowledge can voice their concerns. If built with too cavalier an attitude around safety and security, the authors write, advanced AI systems could eventually spiral out of control, \u201cpotentially resulting in human extinction.\u201d The companies building AI are motivated by the rewards of what\u2019s already shaping up to be an immensely lucrative industry. On the other hand, today\u2019s open letter argues that those same companies don\u2019t have much incentive to be transparent about the potential safety risks of the AI-powered products they\u2019re bringing to market. \u201cAI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHowever, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\u201d Traditional legal protections for whistleblowers, the letter also notes, are reserved for cases involving illegal activity and so would not apply to the as-yet unregulated AI industry. The letter was signed by 13 people with current or former ties to OpenAI and Google DeepMind, most of whom remained anonymous. It was also endorsed by AI luminaries Geoffrey Hinton (who left his post at Google last year to bring attention to the issue of AI safety), Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell. \u201cI think [the open letter is] quite brave and effective, particularly as it\u2019s coming from the inside,\u201d Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Drum. \u201cOpenAI cannot continue telling governments, \u2018Trust us, we\u2019re the experts and we know what we\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d OpenAI has struggled to remain in the good graces of public opinion since it was launched into the cultural spotlight following the release of ChatGPT in 2022. While it\u2019s received billions of dollars in investments from Microsoft and come to be viewed as one of the leaders in the race to build artificial general intelligence (AGI), it\u2019s also attracted the ire of artists and news publishers, who claim that the company has stolen their intellectual property to train large language models. Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, who had previously led OpenAI\u2019s superalignment team \u2013 which focused on optimizing the safety of AI models \u2013 both left the company last month. Leike, who has since been hired by Anthropic, accused his former employer in an X post of sidelining safety as it rushed headlong to launch new products. Then, on May 18, Vox published a report drawing attention to non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses found in employee off-boarding documents at OpenAI. Violating or refusing to sign those clauses could reportedly result in employees forfeiting their vested equity in the company, which for some is valued in the millions of dollars. OpenAI\u2019s PR challenges became even more severe two days later when actress Scarlett Johanssen issued a public statement effectively claiming that her voice had been used without consent by OpenAI to train a new model called GPT-4o. (OpenAI has denied that the model\u2019s voice was based on Johansson.) Incidents like these have led to a perception among critics of some leading AI companies \u2013 and OpenAI in particular \u2013 as reckless juggernauts that, operating in a legal vacuum, have proceeded to steamroll over individuals and institutions in an effort to capture market share. And it\u2019s exactly this scenario, the authors of the new open letter argue, which necessitates mechanisms to protect whistleblowers. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,\u201d the letter reads. OpenAI announced last week that it had formed a new safety and security committee comprised of company board members. The company has not responded to The Drum\u2019s request for comment.",

          "raw_content": "If 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using\u2014and deriving business value from\u2014this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents\u2019 expectations for gen AI\u2019s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead. Organizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI\u2014most notably, inaccuracy\u2014as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value. AI adoption surges Interest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents\u2019 organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services. Also, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2). Gen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value Most respondents now report that their organizations\u2014and they as individuals\u2014are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development\u2014two functions in which previous research determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value \u2014as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents. Gen AI also is weaving its way into respondents\u2019 personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia\u2013Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use. Investments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value The latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents\u201467 percent\u2014expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years. Where are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations\u2014in line with what we found last year\u2014as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales. Inaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use As businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they\u2019re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use. Some organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability. Our previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent. Bringing gen AI capabilities to bear The latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs\u2014though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents\u2019 business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs. Respondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement. Gen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges Gen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it\u2019s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations\u2019 EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations\u2019 EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions\u2014though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations. To start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions\u2014an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they\u2019re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They\u2019re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models. What else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do. Gen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions\u2014that is, to \u201cshift left.\u201d They\u2019re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling. In addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management. About the research The online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function.

Ukraine's military intelligence has been planning this attack and has a strong incentive to disrupt Russian logistics, especially around significant dates like Putin's inauguration. However, the enhanced defenses and recent successful interceptions by Russia indicate a high level of difficulty in executing such an attack.\n\nGiven the historical context of previous successful attacks and the current strategic importance of the bridge, Ukraine is likely to attempt an attack. However, the success of such an attempt is uncertain due to the strong defensive measures in place. The probability of an attack attempt is high, but the probability of a successful hit is moderated by the defensive capabilities.\n\nBalancing these factors, the likelihood of the Crimean Bridge being hit with an attack before May 9, 2024, is significant but not overwhelming. The historical success rate of attacks, combined with the current strategic context, suggests a moderate probability.\n</thinking>\n\n<tentative>0.65</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of successful attacks on the Crimean Bridge, which has been hit twice successfully out of three attempts. This historical success rate, combined with the current strategic context and Ukraine's determination, supports a higher probability of an attack attempt. However, the enhanced defenses and recent successful interceptions by Russia suggest a lower probability of a successful hit.\n\nGiven the balance of these factors and the need to be conservative in conflict predictions, the initial probability of 0.65 seems reasonable but slightly high. Adjusting for the strong defensive measures and feasibility doubts, a more conservative estimate would be appropriate.\n\nFinal probability: *0.60*\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>*0.60*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "They have become a familiar sight in the skies above parts of Russia: long-range enemy drones, buzzing their way to another target. In the biggest Ukrainian onslaught inside Russian territory since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion two years ago, Ukraine has in recent weeks carried out a series of attacks on Russian oil refineries and ports. On Tuesday, it hit a refinery and drone factory in the industrial region of Tatarstan - more than 800 miles from the border. The Ukrainian spy agency behind these drone strikes has its eyes on another target: the 12-mile long Kerch bridge connecting occupied Crimea with Russia. Senior officials from Ukraine\u2019s HUR military intelligence service indicate it is plotting a third attempt on the bridge, after two previous attempts to blow it up, claiming its destruction is \u201cinevitable\u201d. For Putin, the bridge is a tangible reminder of what he sees as one of his greatest political achievements: the peninsula\u2019s 2014 \u201creturn\u201d to Russia using undercover Russian troops and a sham referendum. For Kyiv, the bridge is equally a hated symbol of the Kremlin\u2019s illegal annexation. Its destruction would strengthen Ukraine\u2019s campaign to liberate Crimea and raise morale on and off the battlefield, where Kyiv\u2019s forces are gradually being pushed back. How any Ukrainian attack would unfold is unclear and there are serious doubts about whether the HUR is capable of pulling off a special operation against such a well-defended and obvious target. Russia has taken extensive measures to protect the bridge, strengthening anti-aircraft defences and deploying a \u201ctarget barge\u201d as a decoy for incoming guided missiles. The HUR thinks it can disable the bridge soon. \u201cWe will do it in the first half of 2024,\u201d one official told the Guardian, adding that Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the main directorate of intelligence, already had \u201cmost of the means to carry out this goal\u201d. He was following a plan approved by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to \u201cminimise\u201d Russia\u2019s naval presence in the Black Sea. Over the past five months Ukraine has sunk seven landing boats and large ships belonging to Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The latest, the Sergei Kotov, capsized in March after a night-time raid involving 10 Ukrainian Magura V5 amphibious drones packed with explosives as it was on patrol south of the Kerch bridge. HUR officials indicated this was a \u201cshaping operation\u201d prior to another attack on the crossing. The bridge has been hit and repaired twice before. A 3am raid by Ukrainian sea drones last July caused extensive damage to the road section, which runs parallel to a separate railway section used by Russia\u2019s military to move tanks and supplies. In October 2022 an explosion, Russia said from a bomb smuggled on to a truck, caused several spans of roadway to fall into the water. If the bridge were permanently compromised, Moscow would be forced to transport military supplies by road through occupied southern Ukraine. The route would go via Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, which Russia partly captured in spring 2022. Ukrainian officials believe this would significantly impair the Kremlin\u2019s ability to carry out offensives at a time when its ground forces are advancing. The officials indicated that western weapons would allow Ukraine to destroy the bridge more speedily and Zelenskiy has repeatedly asked Berlin for its long-range Taurus missile system. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has so far refused, arguing that this would be tantamount to his country taking a direct role in the war with Russia, and a dangerous escalation. Pro-Kremlin Russian channels last month released an intercepted phone call in which high-ranking German military officials discussed the capabilities of Taurus. The experts estimated that 10 to 20 missiles would probably be enough to destroy the bridge. Budanov\u2019s deputy, Maj Gen Vadym Skybytskyi, said he believed European politicians were wrong to fear escalation. \u201cWhat does escalation mean for us? We have had two years of war. It\u2019s an everyday procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia bombs our territory. It hits power stations and civilian infrastructure.\u201d He said victory was currently impossible on the battlefield, given Russia\u2019s military superiority and a shortage on the Ukrainian side of artillery shells and fighter jets, and suggested Kyiv had \u201cno choice\u201d but to take the fight to targets deep behind enemy lines, including military infrastructure, command and control centres and industrial production sites that made \u201cweapons and munitions\u201d. Kyiv used a Nato-standard procedure known as centre of gravity or Cog, he added \u2013 a model where outsized results can be achieved by selecting and then eliminating a few carefully picked high-value targets. In recent months the HUR has sought to wipe out Russia\u2019s refining capacity. Its long-range drones have hit Russian oil terminals in Putin\u2019s home city of St Petersburg, more than 1,000km (621 miles) from Ukraine\u2019s border. There have been attacks in the Oryol region, a blast on a train in the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil, and a strike in the Baltic port of Ust-Luga. The Tuapse oil refinery on the Black Sea also caught fire. The Financial Times reported that Washington had urged Kyiv to halt drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure for fear of driving up global oil prices. During Russia\u2019s elections last month there were explosions at fuel facilities in the Oryol and Nizhny Novgorod regions, and in the border region of Belgorod, where pro-Ukrainian Russian fighters using armoured vehicles carried out several separate border incursions. One drone was shot down near Moscow, its mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Ukraine planned to strike more Russian targets, Skybytskyi claimed, with undercover agents playing a part. Some were \u201cRussians with Ukrainian roots\u201d; others were non-ideological Russians recruited in exchange for payments. The \u201cpool\u201d was so large the HUR could pick and choose candidates for sabotage operations, he said. But Russia\u2019s own spy agencies were now back after a period on the back foot, the general added. They had adapted their techniques, he suggested. After Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion, western governments, including the UK, expelled large numbers of career Russian intelligence officers stationed abroad under diplomatic cover. There was apparent proof of the Kremlin\u2019s renewed confidence in February when a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine was found murdered in a Spanish seaside resort. Brigadier-general Dmytro Timkov, the HUR\u2019s top security official, said Maksim Kuzminov had been warned not to leave Ukraine for the EU. He ignored the advice, Timkov said. Timkov compared Ukraine to a patient on life support, in desperate need of further assistance. \u201cWe are attached to a drip. We have enough drugs to stay alive. But if the west wants us to win we need the full treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we fall down.\u201d",

          "raw_content": "Summary The bombing and shelling of populated cities, towns, and villages produces horrific humanitarian consequences. In recent armed conflicts\u2014in Gaza, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, and elsewhere\u2014this use of explosive weapons has killed and injured thousands of civilians and caused foreseeable long-term harm. In November 2022, 83 countries endorsed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas (the Declaration). The Declaration sets standards for preventing and remediating the effects generated by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. There has been growing awareness and concern about the damage and destruction that armed conflict inflicts on cultural heritage. Such heritage ranges from ancient archaeological sites to modern exemplars of architecture, world-renowned monuments to regional museums, places of religious worship to centers for artistic performance. Cultural heritage passes from one generation to another and is of global and local significance. Harm to cultural heritage is, therefore, inseparable from harm to the civilian population. This report examines the connections between the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and damage to and destruction of cultural heritage. It aims to increase awareness of the specific impacts of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and, by extension, civilians. It also offers recommendations for using the recently endorsed Declaration to better protect cultural heritage. While this report focuses on the Declaration as a tool to enhance safeguards within populated areas, cultural heritage should receive comparable protection from explosive weapons wherever it is found. When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery and mortar projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian objects at the time of attack. These weapons also have long-term indirect, or \u201creverberating,\u201d effects. They disrupt civilian infrastructure, which interferes with basic services, infringing on human rights to standard of living, health, and education, among others. In addition, they inflict psychological harm, displace communities, and cause damage to the environment and the subject of this report: cultural heritage. Chapter I of this report provides an overview of the 2022 Declaration and the concept of cultural heritage. The Declaration is dedicated to protecting civilians from the effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. It explicitly enumerates among its list of effects the \u201cdamage and destruction of \u2026 cultural heritage sites\u201d and associated \u201ccivilian suffering.\u201d While this report draws on the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, it adopts a more current definition of \u201ccultural heritage,\u201d which takes into account, for example, heritage of local significance as well as universal value. The effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage warrant attention because cultural heritage protection can help communities recover, preserve intergenerational connections, and save sites of existential meaning to civilians. Chapter II examines how the use of explosive weapons in populated areas endangers cultural heritage. It presents Russia\u2019s ongoing war against Ukraine as a case study. The chapter surveys five examples of attacks on and harm to cultural heritage in Ukraine, including to local museums and archives, cultural sites in urban centers, and places of worship. The case study highlights the frequency, diversity, and gravity of the effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and why these effects matter to the civilian population. The war in Ukraine is just one of several ongoing armed conflicts where cultural heritage has been at grave risk, including from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. In March 2024, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that, since the hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups following the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, the United Nations agency has verified 41 incidents of damage and destruction of cultural heritage in Gaza. The extensive use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas by Israeli forces is evidently the primary cause of this damage. For example, through analysis of satellite imagery, the research group Forensic Architecture found that airstrikes by Israeli forces destroyed the ancient port of Anthedon Harbour, which is on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Because the hostilities began after the bulk of research for this report had been conducted, this report does not include in-depth analysis of this cultural heritage damage, although some incidents are discussed in Chapter III. Drawing on examples from recent armed conflicts in different parts of the world, Chapter III applies the Declaration\u2019s framework of effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas to the cultural heritage context. The chapter describes the direct and indirect effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage. It also shows how such damage and destruction aggravate civilian suffering by directly causing civilian casualties and indirectly inflicting psychosocial, economic, and other types of harm. Chapter IV sets forth how states should interpret and implement the Declaration to enhance protections for cultural heritage. Specifically, it identifies five categories of actions that states should take in this area: preventive steps, data collection and sharing, remedial measures, an inclusive approach, and review and promotion of the Declaration. The chapter analyzes provisions of the Declaration that fall in each of these categories and offers recommendations for applying them in a way that maximizes cultural heritage protection. Finally, Chapter V discusses how the Declaration can bolster current means for safeguarding cultural heritage from armed conflict. The Declaration commits endorsing states to strengthen compliance with and implementation of existing international humanitarian law, which encompasses treaties addressing cultural heritage. More important, it encourages them to go beyond existing law to protect civilians and civilian objects, including through the protection of cultural heritage. This chapter lays out four areas in which the Declaration, if interpreted and implemented as this report recommends, can strengthen and clarify current law to better prevent and remediate cultural heritage-related harm. Recommendations To address the harm to cultural heritage and associated harm to civilians, Human Rights Watch and the International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC) at Harvard Law School call on states to do more to safeguard cultural heritage from the use of explosive weapons. In particular, states should: Endorse, if they have not done so already, the 2022 Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas; Interpret and implement the Declaration to enhance protections for cultural heritage; and Raise awareness of and condemn the foreseeable harm to cultural heritage and, by extension, civilians arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. I. Explosive Weapons and Cultural Heritage This chapter introduces the humanitarian consequences stemming from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and the Declaration that seeks to recognize and respond to this foreseeable and devastating pattern of civilian harm. It also offers a definition of cultural heritage and highlights the importance of its protection, even in the context of other harm to civilians and civilian objects. Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas and the Political Declaration In 2022, 83 countries endorsed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas. As of February 2024, two more states\u2014Jordan and North Macedonia\u2014had joined them. While non-binding, the Declaration if comprehensively implemented has the potential to become a valuable humanitarian tool that provides protection for civilians beyond existing international humanitarian law. When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery and mortar projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian structures at the time of attack. According to one monitoring group, in 2023, as in most years it has reported on since 2011, about 90 percent of the people who are killed or injured when explosive weapons are used in towns and cities are civilians. These weapons also have long-term indirect. or \u201creverberating,\u201d effects. They damage civilian infrastructure, which in turn interferes with basic services such as health care and education, infringing on human rights. They also inflict psychological harm, displace communities, and cause damage to the environment and to the subject of this report\u2014cultural heritage. The harm they cause is exacerbated when the weapons have wide area effects because they have a large blast or fragmentation radius, are inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at once. The International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW) was co-founded in 2011 by Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental organizations to raise awareness of and urge states to address these foreseeable and well-documented humanitarian consequences. In October 2019, representatives of 130 states gathered in Austria for the Vienna Conference on Protecting Civilians in Urban Warfare. Ireland subsequently convened several rounds of consultations to develop a shared understanding of the problem and to produce commitments to address it. The final text of the Declaration was agreed upon in Geneva in June 2022 and formally adopted in Dublin on November 18, 2022. The Declaration is the product of close collaboration among states; United Nations agencies, particularly the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); international organizations, notably the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); and civil society organizations coordinated by INEW. The Declaration aims to advance the protection of civilians from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.[7] Its preamble recognizes the practice\u2019s \u201cdevastating impact on civilians and civilian objects.\u201d The Declaration\u2019s operative paragraphs enumerate commitments to reduce that impact, including through national policies and practices, data collection, victim assistance, and humanitarian access. The introduction, or \u201cchapeau,\u201d to the operative section articulates the document\u2019s overarching purpose and notes that the Declaration commits states to \u201cstrengthening compliance with and improving the implementation of applicable international humanitarian law.\u201d It also makes clear that the Declaration, while non-binding, goes beyond existing international law by committing endorsing states to taking additional steps to advance humanitarian ends. Elaborating on the goals expressed in the Declaration\u2019s title, the chapeau specifically highlights \u201cstrengthening the protection of civilians\u201d and \u201caddressing the humanitarian consequences arising from armed conflict.\u201d These commitments thus refer to the prevention and remediation of harm from explosive weapons in populated areas. The links between explosive weapons and cultural heritage have not been explored in depth, but the connection is clear, and the evidence of harm is strong. The Declaration explicitly enumerates among its list of effects the \u201cdamage and destruction of \u2026 cultural heritage sites\u201d and associated \u201ccivilian suffering.\u201d That harm encompasses physical damage to cultural heritage sites as well as multiple reverberating effects on local communities and humanity as a whole. Consistent with the civilian protection goals of the Declaration and as discussed further in Chapter IV, it is therefore critical to interpret and implement the instrument in a way that improves protection for cultural heritage from the adverse effects of explosive weapons. What is Cultural Heritage? There are different legal definitions of \u201ccultural heritage,\u201d and experts in art history, archaeology, and other related fields have elaborated on the concept. The Declaration does not define what it refers to as \u201ccultural heritage sites,\u201d but states can look to these sources when interpreting and implementing the Declaration in a way that maximizes cultural heritage protection. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict provides a definition of the related term \u201ccultural property,\u201d which is often used in the armed conflict context. Article 1 outlines the following three categories of cultural property: (a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people\u2026; (b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a)\u2026; (c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a)and (b), to be known as \u201ccenters containing monuments.\u201d The definition, which also gives examples of each category, encompasses a broad range of cultural property, including immovable structures (e.g., \u201cmonuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular\u201d); movable objects (e.g., paintings and other works of art, books, manuscripts, etc.); and buildings that house the latter (e.g., museums, archives, and libraries). The definition also establishes a threshold of significance for something to amount to cultural property by stipulating that it must be \u201cof great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.\u201d The Hague Convention\u2019s approach offers the benefits of breadth of",

          "raw_content": "The Ukrainian armed forces have reportedly launched an assault on Russian outposts located on the Crimean Peninsula. According to Ukrainian sources, a dozen ATACMS missiles, supplied by the United States, were deployed against three air defense units of Russia last night. 24/7 BulgarianMilitary.com \u2013 all you need to know about Ukrainian \u2013 Russian war An air defense unit of the Southern Military District, from the Russian Ministry of Defense, located in the village of Donskoe, Simferopol Region, fell victim to the missile attack. This led to an ensuing fire within the military unit\u2019s premises. The assault also targeted Russian military sites, specifically those belonging to the 31st Air Defense Division in the Black Sea and Saki region, with similar missile strikes. In an official response, Russian authorities confirmed the assault. According to their report, they intercepted six of the ATACMS missiles. Along with these missiles, they also claim to have shot down ten Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles and a pair of \u2018Hammer\u2019 guided air bombs, made in France. Reports circulated by pro-Russian bloggers suggest that the missile assault might have originated overnight from Kherson, a region in southern Ukraine. Reports reveal that there have been no aggressive actions by the Ukrainian military forces towards the Kerch Bridge, an essential link between mainland Russia and Crimea. On the contrary, sources have noted that traffic on the bridge was temporarily halted earlier today due to fears of a potential Ukrainian attack. \u201cVehicular movement on the Crimean bridge has been temporarily obstructed,\u201d stated a Telegram channel that regularly provides updates on the status of the Kerch Strait bridge at 1:25 a.m. local time. Nonetheless, normal traffic flow has since resumed. The Kerch Strait Bridge acts as a primary supply route for Russian troops. Prior aggressions on the extensive 19-kilometer [nearly 12-mile] road and rail bridge by Ukraine were documented in October 2022 and again in July 2023. The bridge\u2019s undeniable role in facilitating Moscow\u2019s military activity in southern Ukraine is evident. In their pursuit to reclaim the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, Kyiv has hinted about possible future attacks on this vital structure. Vladimir Rogov, the chairman of a noteworthy pro-Russian group called \u2018We Are Together With Russia\u2019, reported this evening\u2019s activities. He communicated, \u201cThe Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 fighters initiated a missile attack on the Republic of Crimea this evening.\u201d He continued, elucidating, \u201cIn response, Russian air defenses were mobilized over Dzhankoy and Simferopol. Preliminary information suggests our defenders have performed commendably.\u201d According to updates shared by the SHOT Telegram channel, a Russian outlet reputable for its timely military updates, there have been reports of explosions resonating from the city of Simferopol in Crimea and Dzhankoy, which is known to be home to a military airport operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Russia promised a response Recent developments from the Kremlin suggest that if the US decides to equip Kyiv with the advanced ATACMS long-range guided missile systems, Russia may respond by pushing Ukrainian forces further back, thus extending the territory Russia considers as the \u201cneutral zone.\u201d This Russian sentiment gained traction following the US decision in October to supply Kyiv with an ATACMS missile variant capable of striking targets 100 miles away. Emerging reports point toward Congress approving a bill to assemble a new package possibly containing an extended-range missile with a striking radius of up to 186 miles. Last Monday, Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, confirmed Kyiv\u2019s receipt of these long-range ATACMS missiles, expressing his gratitude toward Washington. MGM-140B The updated version of the ATACMS missile system, the MGM-140B, is a spectacular example of innovative engineering. It has been deftly designed to deliver payloads over an impressively extended distance of up to 300 kilometers, signifying a notable leap forward in the evolution of the system. In terms of physical dimensions, the MGM-140B exudes a sense of compact neatness, stretching only about 4 meters, with a modest diameter of about 610 millimeters. However, this seemingly small size conceals a formidable powerhouse in long-range operations. Constructed with resilient, yet lightweight materials, the missile combines an array of composites and alloys. These robust materials ensure that the missile can withstand the rigorous conditions of the launch process and the inevitable stresses of flight. When it comes to operational reach, the MGM-140B truly shines, boasting an awe-inspiring capability of hitting targets up to 300 kilometers away. This extraordinary range is attributed to a robust solid propellant rocket motor, supplying the necessary thrust to propel the missile over these remarkable distances. MGM-140B\u2019s key role According to insights from specialists at the Institute for the Study of War [ISW] in Washington, UK military intelligence, and informed commentators within Russia, the tides of war could be turning due to Ukraine\u2019s recent procurement of American ATACMS long-range missiles. Intriguingly, these exceptional weapons have made their presence known, reportedly targeting the Berdyansk and Luhansk airfields as of October 17. In the preceding year, rumors were rife suggesting the liberation of Kherson from Russian military control could largely be attributed to Ukraine acquiring American medium-range GMLRS missiles. Deployed from the HIMARS platforms, these missiles were instrumental in the obliteration of Chernobayevka airport near Kherson, which had fallen into enemy hands. The mention of this airport stirs up humor and memes even to this day, following last year\u2019s fall events. It serves as an ominous reminder and metaphor in the wake of the October 17 assaults for various military-centric Telegram channels loyal to the Kremlin, including the respected Rybar channel with its alleged Russian connections. Experts reason that Ukraine\u2019s recent acquisition of long-range missiles could have profound effects that extend beyond simply war zones. One plausible scenario forecasts Russia finding it necessary to move their aircraft, helicopters, ammunition storage, and command centers a significant distance away from the frontlines. This strategic shift could afford the Ukrainian army precious extra time, slow down the response of Russian forces, and disrupt their ammunition resupply routes. This strategic edge could potentially mark a turning point for the Ukrainian army. 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine On February 21, 2022, Russia stated that its border facility was attacked by Ukrainian forces, resulting in the deaths of five Ukrainian fighters. However, Ukraine quickly dismissed these allegations, labeling them as \u2018false flags\u2019. In a notable move on the same day, Russia announced it officially recognized the self-proclaimed areas of DPR and LPR. Interestingly, according to Russian President Putin, this recognition covered all the Ukrainian regions. Following this declaration, Putin sent a battalion of Russia\u2019s military forces, tanks included, into these areas. Fast forward to February 24, 2022, global headlines were dominated by a significant incident. Putin commanded a forceful military assault on Ukraine. Led by Russia\u2019s impressive Armed Forces positioned at the Ukrainian border, this assault wasn\u2019t spontaneous but a premeditated action. Despite the circumstances resembling a war, the Russian government refrains from using this term. They\u2019d rather refer to it as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. ***",

          "raw_content": "Officials in Moscow and in occupied Crimea have been quick to say that the July 17 explosion that damaged the only bridge linking Russia to the Black Sea peninsula was not serious and that rail and road traffic over the bridge would be quickly restored. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin asserted that the structure's supporting pylons had not been damaged and that the bridge would be completely repaired by November 1. Nonetheless, the attack struck a key logistical route supplying Russian military forces not only on the Crimean Peninsula but across southern Ukraine, where Kyiv is carrying out a counteroffensive to claw back territory that Russia has occupied since the first weeks of its unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. \u201cThe Crimea Bridge is the main logistical link,\u201d said Pavlo Lakiychuk, a military analyst at the Kyiv-based think tank Strategy XXI. \u201cEven if the railroad bridge was, say, closed for six hours or so and shipping traffic was shut down for a similar period of time, that is a six-hour break for our troops who will have fewer shells raining down on them. That is a plus.\u201d Lakiychuk dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim on July 17 that the bridge \u201chas long not been used\u201d for military transport. \u201cThe bridge has been and remains one of the main supply arteries for supplying Russian forces across southern Ukraine, including in Crimea,\u201d he said. \u201cIncluding those who are defending themselves from the attacks of our forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.\u201d The bridge, he said, is used to supply heavy equipment, ammunition such as artillery shells, fuel, and other crucial, ongoing needs of Russian forces in Ukraine. \u201cDelaying [these supplies] for an hour or two or three or six or 12 is a vital matter for our troops, who are engaged in heavy fighting,\u201d Lakiychuk said. \u201cThe river of military supplies for Russia has slowed to a trickle,\u201d he concluded. Andriy Yusov, the spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR), offered a similar assessment on July 17, saying: \u201cAny logistical problems are one more complication for the occupiers that creates a potential advantage for Ukrainian defense forces.\u201d Khusnullin, the Russian deputy prime minister who was put in charge of the repair works, wrote on Telegram early on July 18 that one lane of the bridge had been reopened for vehicle traffic. Immediate Impact The damage to the bridge also had an immediate impact for civilians in Crimea. Supplies of food and other essentials via the bridge were halted at least temporarily, and Russian occupation authorities warned that it could be days before truck traffic is restored. Trucks were being diverted to ferries, which can be unpredictable due to frequent high winds on the strait. This month, before the attack, truckers were already reporting that inspections and the ferry transit took around three hours. When explosions were heard in the city of Kerch at the Crimea end of the bridge on July 9, de facto officials had to quickly calm people by reporting that the bridge was not targeted. \u201cPeople in Crimea are right to worry about the Kerch bridge because transit through Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory is not safe,\u201d Lakiychuk said. The news outlet Kerch.fm reported in June that truck drivers were refusing to travel between Russia and Crimea via the occupied parts of southern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov coast out of safety concerns and were insisting on higher pay for coping with the delays at the ferries. \u201cBecause of the hours-long waits in line for the ferry, they are demanding \u2018waiting fees,\u2019\u201d the website quoted an employee at a Crimean butcher shop as saying. \u201cDrivers either do not want to go to Crimea or they are charging double to do so.\u201d Increasingly, Crimea resembles a war zone, and the peninsula has been targeted by a mounting number of drone and other attacks in 2023. The occupation authorities have undertaken a massive program of building trenches and other fortifications. However, Ukrainian military analyst Mykhaylo Prytula, a retired army colonel, told RFE/RL that Kyiv\u2019s strategy is to isolate the peninsula as much as possible. \u201cAt some point, Crimea will simply be an island without any connection to the mainland or via the Kerch bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a Crimea without water. Without military supplies\u2026. All that will be working will be the airports and the ports. Car traffic will be closed, and people will not be able to evacuate their possessions.\u201d \u201cAt that point, the only choice will be to surrender or to flee,\u201d Prytula said. The 19-kilometer Crimea Bridge, which facilitates both automotive and rail traffic, was completed in May 2018 at a cost of some $4 billion. It was a significant prestige project intended to bolster Moscow\u2019s claim to Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region that was inaugurated by Putin in person. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast -- the second attack to do substantial damage to the bridge in 10 months -- but Ukrainian media reported that security services had deployed two maritime drones to carry out the operation. Lakiychuk said that could signal a significant technological breakthrough for Kyiv. Ukraine, he said, only began developing sea-based drones after Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion and the work has been carried out \u201cunder wartime conditions.\u201d \u201cIf this is so, the Russian side wasn\u2019t ready for the Ukrainian military\u2019s capability of using such drones so far away from its military bases,\u201d he said. Crimea Becoming A Frontline Zone? He added that such operations generate valuable information for Ukrainian intelligence services that makes future operations more likely to succeed. \u201cIntelligence will have a lot of work now,\u201d Laviychuk said. The July 17 blast followed a major explosion and fire in October 2022 that prevented the full operation of the bridge for months. Lakiychuk said the fact that bridge spans collapsed in both cases could indicate that the foundation of the structure has vulnerabilities. \u201cIf the spans are falling, that means that the supports beneath them are shifting,\u201d he said. The explosion, which Russia said killed a married couple in a car and injured their 14-year-old daughter, will likely reinforce the growing impression that Crimea is a \u201cfrontline zone,\u201d to use the formulation of Refat Chubarov, the Kyiv-based president of the Worldwide Congress of Crimean Tatars and chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, a self-governing body that Russia declared illegal after occupying the peninsula in 2014. After the October 2022 explosion on the bridge, Russia was forced to intensify security checks and other measures for traffic moving in both directions, Chubarov told RFE/RL on June 30, before the most recent blast, causing alarm and frustration for travelers. \u201cThese measures will continue as long as the bridge stands, until it is destroyed by Ukrainian rockets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that will happen soon.\u201d Written by RFE/RL\u2019s Robert Coalson based on reporting by RFE/RL\u2019s Crimea.Realities, RFE/RL\u2019s Russian Service, and Current Time.",

          "raw_content": "Russia pulled out of a critical grain deal. Here's everything you need to know Russia has withdrawn from a deal that allows Ukraine to safely export grain to the global market. The decision is being widely criticized as Ukrainian officials urge other leaders to continue the deal without Russia. The key Crimean bridge linking the annexed peninsula to Russia was hit by two strikes early Monday. The Black Sea grain deal: What to know about the deal: The agreement, brokered last year by Turkey and the United Nations, allowed Kyiv to export grain from its ports and navigate safe passage through the Black Sea after Moscow blockaded docks in the region. The deal had been renewed three times, but Russia has argued that it has been hampered in exporting its own products. Over the weekend, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that he would not renew the pact, saying that its main purpose \u2014 to supply grain to countries in need \u2014 had \u201cnot been realized.\u201d What Ukraine is saying: Ukraine wants some version of the deal to continue even without Russia. The head of the Ukrainian Grain Association urged the international community to \u201cfind the leverage\u201d to keep moving grain. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he sent official letters to Turkey\u2019s president and the United Nations secretary general with a proposal on how to continue the initiative. Consequences: Wheat and corn prices on global commodities markets jumped Monday after Russia pulled out of the deal. The collapse of the pact threatens to push up food prices for consumers worldwide. In addition to wheat exports, Ukraine is among the world\u2019s top three exporters of barley, maize and rapeseed oil, according to agricultural data firm Gro Intelligence. It is also by far the biggest exporter of sunflower oil, according to the United Nations. Global reaction: Western officials criticized Moscow\u2019s decision to withdraw from the deal. The White House said Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the plan will worsen food insecurity around the world and urged Russia to reverse its decision. The United Kingdom called the decision a \u201cblatant attempt to harm the most vulnerable as part of its illegal war.\u201d The European Union\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell described Russia\u2019s decision as \u201ccompletely unjustified, weaponizing, the hunger of the people.\u201d France called on Russia to \u201cstop blackmailing global food security.\u201d The Kerch Bridge: Key Crimean bridge attacked: A source from Ukraine\u2019s security service (SBU) said the attack on the Kerch Bridge, which killed a couple and injured their daughter, was a joint operation of the SBU and Ukraine\u2019s naval forces. The Kremlin claimed two Ukrainian seaborne drones struck the bridge, though it did not provide evidence for the allegation. The Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation later said the bridge was struck by \u201cnaval drones.\u201d Putin called it a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d and directed his country\u2019s authorities to investigate. Why is the bridge important?: The $3.7 billion Kerch Bridge is strategically important because it links Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region with the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. It was the physical expression of Putin\u2019s objective to take over Ukraine and bind it to Russia forever and serves as a vital supply line for Moscow\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. Other developments: The eastern front: Russian forces are redeploying around the embattled city of Bakhmut to try and stop Kyiv\u2019s offensive, a top Ukrainian general said. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of the land forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said conditions on the eastern front are \u201cchallenging.\u201d Russia has also concentrated more than 100,000 soldiers in the Kupyansk area, a Ukrainian official said. The southern front: Ukraine says it is advancing along the southern front, despite Russian airstrikes and a large concentration of landmines, according to the commander of the Tavria Joint Forces. Brig. Gen. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi said Monday. He added that Russian forces had been battering Ukrainian forces, but said the soldiers under his command were firing back. Ukrainian foreign minister questions whether Kerch Bridge can be considered civilian infrastructure Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba challenged whether the Kerch Bridge, which was attacked early Monday, could be considered civilian infrastructure when he said it\u2019s mainly used for military purposes. A Ukrainian security official earlier on Monday claimed Kyiv\u2019s responsibility for an attack on the bridge linking the annexed Crimean peninsula to the Russian mainland \u2014 a vital supply line for Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine and a personal project for President Vladimir Putin. The nearly 12-mile crossing is the longest in Europe and holds huge strategic and symbolic importance for Moscow. Monday\u2019s attack on the bridge was the second since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine after a fuel tanker exploded while crossing it in October. UN-appointed human rights experts call for the immediate release of imprisoned US journalist Gershkovich UN-appointed human rights experts called for the immediate release of imprisoned US journalist Evan Gershkovich on Monday, according to a release on the UN website. Mariana Katzarova, Special Rapporteur on human rights in Russia and Irene Khan, Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, responded to Gershkovich\u2019s arrest and detention while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia. The Special Rapporteurs lodged an appeal over Gershkovich\u2019s arbitrary arrest with the Russian authorities on June 12 and called for his immediate release, the UN website said. No response has been received to date. This comes days after US President Joe Biden said he is \u201cserious\u201d about a prisoner exchange to free wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter. CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. Ukrainian defense minister thanks US for supplying cluster munitions Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov on Monday discussed several topics with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, including the situation on the battlefield and the needs of the Ukrainian Army in regard to weapons and equipment. Reznikov thanked Austin and the US \u201cfor the supply of cluster munitions.\u201d The US has confirmed it sent cluster munitions to Ukraine as part of a new military aid package. The munitions arrived in Ukraine July 14, according to the Pentagon. CNN first reported earlier in July that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration was strongly considering approving the transfer of the controversial weapons to Ukraine, whose forces have been struggling to make major gains in a weeks-long counteroffensive. Zelensky: Russia does not have the \"right to destroy the food security of any nation\" Ukraine\u2019s president on Monday blasted Russia\u2019s decision to pull out of the Black Sea grain deal, saying, \u201cno one has the right to destroy the food security of any nation.\u201d Russia said it was suspending its participation in a crucial deal that allowed the export of Ukrainian grain, once again raising fears over global food supplies. The deal \u2014 originally brokered by Turkey and the United Nations a year ago \u2014 ensured the safe passage of ships carrying grain from Ukrainian ports in the midst of Russia\u2019s invasion. So far the deal has allowed for the export of almost 33 million metric tons of food through Ukrainian ports, according to UN data. Zelensky said throughout the course of the war, Russia \u201cdestroyed navigation freedom in the Black and Azov seas\u201d and attacked Ukrainian ports and grain terminals. \u201cThe only possible consequence of this is the destabilization of food markets and social chaos in the countries critically dependent on food imports. Ukrainian food is basic security for four hundred million people,\u201d the president said. Zelenksy said the deal should keep operating without Russia. He said he sent official letters to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres with a proposal to continue the initiative. Ukraine can export grain without Russia if provided international support, grain association president says The international community needs to \u201cfind the leverage\u201d to move grain from Ukraine to the global market without Russia, the head of the Ukrainian Grain Association said Monday. Nikolay Gorbachov said he is \u201csure that Ukraine can export grain without Russia\u201d if it is provided \u201cinternational support.\u201d It comes after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal. \u201cThe international community, developed countries have to find the leverage how to move grain from Ukraine to the world market,\u201d the president told CNN. According to Gorbachov, this support could come from the Turkish fleet or insurance guarantees from companies. Gorbachov refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s claims that Ukraine has not fulfilled a vital part of the grain deal in ensuring grain is exported to poorer countries, calling it \u201cmanipulation.\u201d Although 60% of grain exported from Ukraine moves through European ports, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that Europe absorbs this grain as a final consumer,\u201d he said, adding that Ukrainian grain feeds about 200 million people outside the country. Gorbachov maintained that Ukraine\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s leading grain producers should drive countries to intervene sooner rather than later. Ukrainian foreign minister holding \"urgent consultations\" at UN over grain deal The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says he\u2019s holding \u201curgent consultations\u201d at the United Nations following Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. \u201cOn [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s] instruction, I am holding urgent consultations with partners at the UN in New York on our next steps following Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Grain Initiative,\u201d Kuleba tweeted Monday. \u201cRussia puts global food security in jeopardy. We do our utmost to preserve the Black Sea grain corridor.\u201d It's early morning in Crimea. Here's what you need to know A Moscow-backed official in annexed Crimea said early Monday that an \u201cemergency incident\u201d has been reported on the Crimean bridge, halting traffic on the only link between the peninsula and Russia. Sergey Aksenov, the Russia-appointed head of Crimea, did not specify the nature of the incident. Last October, a huge blast partially damaged the bridge, causing parts of it to collapse. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defense minister made what appeared to be the clearest admission yet that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the October 8 attack. Here are some other key developments surrounding Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine: Putin\u2019s remarks: Russian President Vladimir Putin painted the Ukrainian counteroffensive as \u201cunsuccessful\u201d in an interview with a pro-Kremlin journalist published Sunday. Ukraine acknowledges the campaign has been characterized by tough fighting and limited progress but insists it does not feel under pressure by Western allies to deliver quick results as it does the hard work of driving Russian forces out of its territory. On the front lines: Ukraine reported fierce battles in the east, with the two sides swapping fighting positions and Russia going on the offensive in some areas. Outside the long-contested city of Bakhmut, Ukraine\u2019s military has reported slow but steady progress. In southern Ukraine, heavy Russian attacks wounded multiple people in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions on the weekend, Ukrainian officials said. Grain deal on the brink: The crucial agreement that allows the export of grain from Ukrainian ports is set to expire Monday unless Russia agrees to an extension. The deal will end at midnight July 17 into July 18 Istanbul time (5 p.m. ET on Monday), a UN spokesperson said. The Kremlin has voiced displeasure with the pact, objecting in particular to the way international sanctions affect its own exports. Cluster bombs in focus: Putin said Ukraine using cluster munitions should be considered a \u201ccrime,\u201d and vowed to retaliate if Kyiv uses the ones recently supplied by the US. But Putin\u2019s own forces have been using the controversial weapons throughout the course of the war, according to Ukraine, the United Nations and a CNN investigation from last year. Read more about both countries\u2019 use of the controversial bombs here. US ammunition running low: The United States is running low on ammunition from its own stockpile as the country works to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia, according to US national security adviser Jake Sullivan. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, upon taking office, found that overall stocks of the NATO standard ammunition used for artillery rounds \u201cwas relatively low,\u201d Sullivan told CNN. F-16s debate: Sullivan confirmed Sunday the US will allow European countries to start training Ukrainian pilots to use F-16 fighter jets, after reports that Europe was still awaiting formal approval. The US has not yet said it will supply Kyiv with the planes, however. Two US lawmakers offered differing perspectives on whether that constitutes \u201cslow-rolling\u201d the",
