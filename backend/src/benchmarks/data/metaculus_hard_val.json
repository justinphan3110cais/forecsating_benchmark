      "### <facts>\n1. **Call for Expulsion**: The Philippine national security adviser, Eduardo Ano, has called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats over a leaked telephone transcript involving a Philippine admiral and Chinese officials.\n2. **Alleged Violations**: The Philippines accuses the Chinese embassy of spreading disinformation and violating the Anti-Wire Tapping Act.\n3. **Chinese Response**: China's foreign ministry criticized the Philippines' stance, asserting it undermines diplomatic norms and indicated a strong response to any perceived threats.\n4. **Escalating Tensions**: Tensions between China and the Philippines have been escalating, with aggressive actions from China, including water cannons, collisions, and military-grade lasers to hinder Philippine resupply efforts.\n5. **Diplomatic Norms**: Both nations are entrenched in their respective narratives, with significant deterioration in bilateral relations.\n6. **International Context**: The U.S. has strengthened ties with the Philippines, viewing it as a potential ally against China, and has increased its military presence in the region.\n7. **Investigations**: The Philippines is investigating the alleged disinformation campaign and potential violations of wiretapping laws by Chinese diplomats.\n8. **Historical Context**: Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are not unprecedented in international relations, especially under heightened tensions.\n</facts>\n\n### <no>\n1. **Diplomatic Norms and Restraint**: Both countries may prefer to avoid further escalation and adhere to diplomatic norms to prevent a full-blown diplomatic crisis. (Strength: 8)\n2. **Economic and Political Costs**: Expulsions or recalls could have significant economic and political repercussions, which both countries might want to avoid. (Strength: 7)\n3. **International Mediation**: There might be efforts from international actors, such as the U.S., to mediate and de-escalate the situation. (Strength: 6)\n4. **Ongoing Investigations**: The Philippines might wait for the outcome of their investigations before taking any drastic actions. (Strength: 5)\n</no>\n\n### <yes>\n1. **High Tensions and Aggressive Actions**: The ongoing aggressive actions by China and the strong stance by the Philippines indicate a high likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls. (Strength: 8)\n2. **Precedent of Expulsions**: Historical precedents show that diplomatic expulsions are a common response to such violations and escalations. (Strength: 7)\n3. **Domestic Pressure**: The Philippine government might face domestic pressure to take a strong stance against China, leading to expulsions. (Strength: 6)\n4. **Strategic Posturing**: Both countries might use expulsions or recalls as a strategic move to assert their positions in the South China Sea dispute. (Strength: 6)\n</yes>\n\n### <thinking>\nThe situation between the Philippines and China is highly tense, with significant provocations and aggressive actions from both sides. The call for expulsion by the Philippine national security adviser and the strong response from China suggest a high potential for diplomatic actions such as expulsions or recalls. However, the potential economic and political costs, along with the desire to adhere to diplomatic norms, might restrain both countries from taking such actions immediately.\n\nThe ongoing investigations by the Philippines could delay any immediate expulsions, and international mediation efforts might also play a role in de-escalating the situation. Historical precedents and the current high tensions do support the likelihood of expulsions, but the cautious approach typically taken in international diplomacy might mitigate this.\n\nConsidering the balance of these factors, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls before June 1, 2024, is significant but not certain. The cautious approach and potential for de-escalation efforts weigh against the high tensions and aggressive posturing.\n\n### <cautious>\n1. **Media Bias**: Media sources often emphasize conflict and drama, potentially exaggerating the likelihood of extreme actions like diplomatic expulsions.\n2. **Diplomatic Restraint**: Historically, countries often show restraint in diplomatic expulsions to avoid escalating conflicts further.\n3. **Economic Interdependence**: Both countries have significant economic ties, which might deter them from taking drastic diplomatic actions.\n4. **International Pressure**: There might be significant international pressure to resolve the issue diplomatically rather than through expulsions or recalls.\n</cautious>\n\n### <tentative>\n0.45\n</tentative>\n\n### <thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it seems reasonable given the high tensions and aggressive actions, balanced by the potential for diplomatic restraint and international mediation. The base rate for diplomatic expulsions in similar high-tension situations is not extremely high, and the specific context here suggests a moderate probability. The cautious considerations, especially regarding media bias and economic interdependence, further support a conservative estimate.\n\nFinal factors:\n- High tensions and aggressive actions increase the likelihood.\n- Diplomatic norms, economic costs, and potential for international mediation decrease the likelihood.\n- Media bias and historical restraint in similar situations suggest caution.\n\n### <answer>\n*0.45*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "In the latest escalation in tensions, the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday urged the Philippines to \u201cstop infringing on China\u2019s right and provoking China\u201d. This came a few hours after Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano echoed a call on Wednesday from Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro for the Philippine foreign ministry to \u201ctake appropriate actions against individuals in the Chinese embassy \u2026 for violating Philippine law, particularly the Anti-Wire Tapping Act as well as for serious breaches of diplomatic protocols and conventions\u201d. In a statement on Friday, Ano accused the Chinese embassy in Manila of \u201crepeated acts of engaging and dissemination of disinformation, misinformation and malinformation\u201d, and called for the Chinese diplomats responsible to be expelled. On Tuesday the Chinese embassy in Manila reportedly released to selected media outlets a transcript of the purported phone call between a Chinese diplomat and a Philippine navy officer, prompting the accusations of wiretapping from outraged Philippine officials. \u201cTranscripts can easily be fabricated, and audio recordings can be manufactured by using deep fakes. These reports only aim to serve as a distraction from the China Coast Guard\u2019s ongoing aggressive behaviour,\u201d Brawner said. In Beijing on Friday, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Ano\u2019s statement \u201cprecisely proved\u201d that the Philippine side had \u201cbecome weak in the face of facts and evidence\u201d. \u201cChina solemnly demands that the Philippine side ensure the normal performance of duties by Chinese diplomatic personnel, stop infringing on China\u2019s right and provoking China, and refrain from denying the facts or acting rashly,\u201d he added. Hu Bo, director of Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, said bilateral diplomatic ties had sunk to \u201cthe worst level\u201d in recent decades. \u201cEven at the time of the arbitration case [at The Hague], the Benigno Aquino III administration didn\u2019t deny the agreement over the Second Thomas Shoal,\u201d Hu said. He was referring to an arbitration case filed by Manila in 2013 to challenge Beijing\u2019s claims to almost the whole of the South China Sea under what it calls its historic \u201cnine-dash line\u201d. According to a 2013 report by the news portal Inquirer.net, then Philippine defence secretary Voltaire Gazmin had told then Chinese ambassador Ma Keqing that the Philippines would \u201cnot violate the agreement not to construct new structures\u201d on the Second Thomas Shoal, after Beijing raised its concerns over Manila\u2019s reported plans to do so. \u201cNow the Philippines\u2019 policy has turned upside down, which is a significant change compared with previous governments,\u201d Hu said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that the two governments are now sticking to their own version with no compromise. \u201cChina has been on defensive but if the Philippines continues to push, I don\u2019t think China will show any mercy.\u201d The international tribunal at The Hague ruled in Manila\u2019s favour in 2016, but Beijing has refused to acknowledge the court decision. Ding Duo, an associate research fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, also said that Beijing would take \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d against the Philippines. To manage disputes at sea, China had also made \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreements\u201d with other rival claimants, including Vietnam and Malaysia, he added. \u201cChina will certainly respond with strong countermeasures regardless whether it is from the perspective of defending the rights of the sea, or from the perspective of domestic public opinion, or even from the perspective of preventing other countries from following the footsteps of the Philippines.\u201d The two countries have had a series of confrontations around the Second Thomas Shoal in recent months, with Manila accusing the Chinese coastguard of blocking resupply missions to a grounded warship that hosts a handful of troops. Water cannons have been used against Philippine ships and China has also been accused of ramming vessels. According to Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, Manila\u2019s \u201cassertive transparency\u201d in publicising these incidents had put Beijing on the back foot. \u201cThere is no way China can back down from anything because of domestic reasons, and there\u2019s no sign that the Philippines is abandoning the current strategy Manila believes is quite effective.\u201d Koh said even if Manila was able to identify who had made the recording, \u201cthere would be growing pressure on the Philippine government to expel people within the Chinese embassy \u2026 and that is going to cause more issues between the two countries.\u201d",

          "raw_content": "By Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) -The Philippines' national security adviser called on Friday for Chinese diplomats to be expelled over an alleged leak of a phone conversation with a Filipino admiral in a significant escalation of a bitter row over the South China Sea. China's embassy in Manila had orchestrated \"repeated acts of engaging and dissemination of disinformation, misinformation and malinformation\", with the objective of sowing discord, division and disunity, Eduardo Ano said in a statement. Those actions \"should not be allowed to pass unsanctioned without serious penalty\", he said. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian called the comments provocative and said Chinese diplomats in the Philippines had to be allowed to do their job. \"China solemnly requests the Philippine side to effectively safeguard the normal performance of duties by Chinese diplomatic personnel, stop infringing and provoking, and refrain from denying the facts,\" Lin said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. The office of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The two countries have been embroiled in a series of heated stand-offs this past year in disputed areas of the South China Sea as the Philippines, emboldened by support from the United States and other allies, steps up activities in waters occupied by China's vast coast guard. Asked to comment on the latest row, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said: \"We are aware of the media reports and defer to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs.\" China has accused the Philippines of trespassing and of treachery, while Manila has scolded Beijing for what it says is a policy of aggression and dangerous manoeuvring inside its exclusive economic zone. The expelling of diplomats could intensify a row that has so far seen heated exchanges, diplomatic protests and the ramming and water-cannoning of Philippine ships at two disputed shoals, the closest of which is more than 850 km (530 miles) away from mainland China. Ano was referring to a news report this week of an alleged leak of a call between a Chinese diplomat and a Filipino admiral discussing a dispute over the South China Sea, which carried a transcript that showed the admiral agreeing to concessions with China. According to the transcript published by the Manila Times, the admiral agreed to China's proposal of a \"new model\", where the Philippines would use fewer vessels in resupply trips to marines stationed at a grounded warship at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, and notify Beijing about the missions in advance. Reuters has not heard the reported phone conversation and could not verify the contents of the published transcript. The report said the conversation had taken place in January and the transcript was provided by a \"ranking Chinese official\", which it did not name. 'INTERFERENCE OPERATIONS' Ano said he backed the defence minister's call for the foreign ministry to take appropriate action against embassy officials, who he claimed recorded an alleged phone conversation in violation of Philippine laws, including its anti-wire tapping act, as well as serious breaches of diplomatic protocols. \"Those individuals in the Chinese embassy ... and those responsible for these malign influence and interference operations must be removed from the country immediately,\" he said. On Wednesday, Chinese spokesperson Lin said the embassy in Manila had released details about \"relevant communications\" between the two countries on managing the situation at the Second Thomas Shoal. Lin, in comments shared by the embassy, did not elaborate on what details or communications were released, or when, but said \"facts are clear and backed by hard evidence that cannot be denied\". \"The Philippines has insisted on denying these objective facts and seeks to mislead the international community,\" Lin added. China has long been vexed by the Philippines' maintaining its small military presence aboard the grounded warship Sierre Madre at the Second Thomas Shoal, where it has been since 1999 to try to prop up its territorial claim. Beijing has repeatedly said the Philippines had agreed to tow that ship away, which Manila denies. Manila-based political analyst Julio Amador said expelling diplomats should be part of the Philippines' diplomatic tool kit and Chinese embassy officials had shown they did not value their working relationships with Filipino officials. \"Diplomacy is based on trust, yet China is trying to make it look like all meetings between its diplomats and Philippine government representatives are negotiations with binding results,\" he said. \"It has no right to make demands on the Philippines on how the latter manages areas over which it has sovereign rights.\" (Additional reporting by Joe Cash and David Brunnstrom; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Neil Fullick and Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

          "raw_content": "In Fareed Zakaria\u2019s May 5 op-ed, \u201cA hawkish strategy on China is a big mistake,\u201d he argued in response to our recent Foreign Affairs article, \u201cNo Substitute for Victory: America\u2019s Competition With China Must Be Won, Not Managed,\u201d that it\u2019s simply too hard to contain America\u2019s primary adversary. But his view that U.S.-China relations are on the upswing is mistaken. And while Mr. Zakaria laid out the risks of countering China, he didn\u2019t tally the costs of failing to act at this crucial juncture. The heart of our position, as Mr. Zakaria noted, is that the Biden administration\u2019s policy of \u201cmanaging competition\u201d with Beijing is a rehash of the failed \u201cd\u00e9tente\u201d policies that Washington employed in the 1970s to cope with a militarily resurgent Soviet Union. We argue that this is a dangerous policy because it breeds complacency by the American people and signals weakness to Beijing at a time when Chinese leader Xi Jinping is fostering international chaos and advancing a global vision hostile to democracies. Recent events have proved our point. Far from Mr. Zakaria\u2019s contention that \u201ctensions have in fact calmed down\u201d recently between Washington and Beijing, the Biden administration\u2019s conciliatory approach has in reality been met with hostility from Beijing. China has sold skyrocketing amounts of crucial materiel to Russia for use in its war in Europe and offered growing diplomatic support for Iran and its terrorist proxies such as Hamas. Xi\u2019s government subsidizes companies supplying the illegal fentanyl trade responsible for the overdoses that are now, as The Post has reported, the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 49. Secretary of State Antony Blinken even cited new evidence of \u201cattempts to influence and arguably interfere\u201d in U.S. elections. Advertisement Mr. Zakaria objected to our vision for a policy of calling out and imposing costs on Beijing for the harm it is doing to the United States and its allies. He argued China\u2019s economy is too big and too well integrated into the world economy for a Ronald Reagan-inspired Cold War policy to work and that U.S. allies would prefer to placate Beijing than confront it. He\u2019s not wrong that this strategy would have challenges, but we believe he overestimated the difficulty \u2014 and underestimated the benefits \u2014 of succeeding. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the world\u2019s second biggest economy, as China is today. The CIA estimated that the Soviet economy in the mid-1970s reached 57 percent of the size of the U.S. economy, just shy of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s recent estimate that China\u2019s economy is about 65 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. But the United States often overestimated Soviet economic growth during the Cold War, and the same is almost certainly true with respect to China\u2019s economy today. It is true that China and the United States do vastly greater bilateral trade than the United States ever did with the Soviet Union and that China (unlike the Soviet Union) has a \u201cmixture of private and public sector\u201d companies, as Mr. Zakaria noted. But the Soviet economy traded more heavily with other parts of the world than many people recall. And China\u2019s semiprivate, ruling-party-led, autarkic economic model shouldn\u2019t deter us from pursuing a hard-nosed policy any more than the eerily similar economic model of 1930s Germany should have intimidated us into paralysis back then. Advertisement As for the argument that some of our allies are reluctant to contain our primary adversary: What else is new? Reagan was deeply frustrated that some Western European countries \u2014 West Germany in particular \u2014 increased their dependency on Russian energy exports in the 1980s. This didn\u2019t dissuade Reagan. In the end, European countries followed Washington\u2019s lead and leveraged Soviet reliance on their markets to their advantage \u2014 much the way industrialized democracies can make China\u2019s overreliance on access to our markets today a liability for Beijing. In addition to these substantive disagreements, much of the rest of Mr. Zakaria\u2019s column caricatured our article as advocating something like a regime change strategy toward China. That is an unfortunate diversion, especially because we explicitly disavowed such a policy. We hope Mr. Zakaria does not object to our first goal of dissuading China\u2019s leaders from trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and its friends, given that Beijing is providing decisive material support to Russia\u2019s war in Europe, serving up diplomatic and propaganda support for Iran\u2019s proxy wars in the Middle East, and moving to seize territory in the South China Sea administered by the Philippines, a U.S. ally. Advertisement And we question why he should find it \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for us \u2014 or for any American \u2014 to express hope that Chinese citizens will someday find inspiration to explore new models of development and governance that don\u2019t rely on repression at home and compulsive hostility abroad, as we did in Foreign Affairs. That has been the goal of most U.S. presidents since Woodrow Wilson \u2014 and with good reason. It\u2019s an essential American idea. Mike Gallagher, Green Bay, Wis. Matt Pottinger, Palo Alto, Calif. Mr. Gallagher is a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin and served as chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Pottinger is chairman of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan.\u201d An existential threat Regarding George F. Will\u2019s May 2 op-ed, \u201cThe forgotten election issue: Nuclear war\u201d: Advertisement I applaud Mr. Will\u2019s concern about the seemingly forgotten nuclear threat, which he illustrated in his recent op-ed. But I am saddened that someone so thoughtful and observant appears to discount what he described as \u201chysteria\u201d about the \u201cdistant threat of climate change.\u201d Reporting by The Post and many other publications has for years outlined the causes and devastating effects of global warming that have already occurred. While climate change does not threaten the instantaneous annihilation of a nuclear war, it could bring an existential end \u2014 and sooner than most expect. In my view, the United States needs a president who understands the critical nature of both threats. With these concerns in mind, I hope Mr. Will might remind his readers that in one of his first acts in office, President Biden called for a five-year extension of the U.S.-Russian agreement limiting strategic nuclear weapons, which was about to expire. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed, even though President Donald Trump had rejected the same proposal when Mr. Putin offered it. In 2019, Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, which had eliminated both parties\u2019 medium-range nuclear missiles. And in 2020, Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Open Skies Treaty, which built confidence and reduced the danger of miscalculations that could lead to nuclear war. I offer these data points in strong agreement with Mr. Will that voters should take the risk of nuclear war into account when they cast their ballots on Nov. 5. Anne Gruner, McLean Advertisement The writer was an intelligence adviser to Ambassador Paul Nitze during the negotiations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. George F. Will\u2019s column draws needed attention to Annie Jacobsen\u2019s book \u201cNuclear War: A Scenario,\u201d a much-needed reminder of the growing danger of nuclear war and the urgent need to prevent it. Unfortunately, in his conclusion, Mr. Will falls back on the old Cold War assumption, \u201cTalk of \u2018banning the bomb\u2019 is pointless.\u201d Jacobsen\u2019s book is a profoundly convincing argument that that is exactly what we must do. As Mr. Will himself pointed out, \u201cHumanity\u2019s survival depends on statesmanship and luck \u2014 as much the latter as the former.\u201d But luck doesn\u2019t last forever, and the policy of all nuclear-armed states \u2014 a hope for perpetual good luck \u2014 is wildly unrealistic. If these weapons are not removed, it would be a question of \u201cwhen\u201d not \u201cif\u201d they will be used. Advertisement The Back from the Brink campaign and House Resolution 77 call on the United States to acknowledge that the existence of nuclear weapons is the greatest security threat we face and to negotiate their elimination with the other eight nuclear-armed states. We cannot know that such an initiative will succeed, but there is no reason to assume it will fail. And there is no downside to trying. If we fail, we are no worse off than we are today. If we succeed, we can save the world. Ira Helfand, Northampton, Mass. The writer is a past president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. George F. Will\u2019s recent op-ed argued that voters should care more about the risk of nuclear war than the threat of climate change. But by his own logic, climate change ought to be a larger factor in determining who is fit to be president. Advertisement If nuclear weapons are \u201chere forever,\u201d if \u201ctalk of \u2018banning the bomb\u2019 is pointless,\u201d if humanity\u2019s survival depends more on \u201cluck\u201d than diplomacy and if any leader anywhere in the world decides to pull the nuclear trigger, events would cascade into disaster, and very little would depend on the identity of the U.S. president. Climate change, however, is an actionable issue. But whether that action is taken depends on who next leads the United States. The president is in a position to affect the actions this country will take, and the example it will set globally, in addressing climate-related decisions. So, to my mind, this, not the ongoing possibility of nuclear war, is the far more pressing concern when it comes to selecting a president this year \u2014 as well as in future years.",

          "raw_content": "The Philippines said Monday it was officially investigating allegations that Chinese embassy staff in Manila had engaged in a disinformation campaign related to the South China Sea. The move followed a call by the Philippine national security adviser urging the government to expel embassy staffers for allegedly recording a phone conversation with a senior Filipino commander about military resupply missions to a disputed shoal. \u201cThe Department of Foreign Affairs will look into any reports of illegal and unlawful activities by diplomatic officials, and undertake necessary action in line with existing laws and regulations,\u201d the department said in a statement Monday. While foreign diplomats are \u201caccorded necessary liberties\u201d in conducting their duties, they are expected to perform them \u201cwith the highest standards of integrity\u201d and professionalism, it said. Last week, top Philippine defense and security officials demanded an investigation into whether China had violated Manila\u2019s wiretapping laws during the alleged phone call between a Chinese official and the Filipino government military commander, Vice Adm. Alberto Carlos, who oversees the defense of the Second Thomas Shoal, also known as the Ayungin Shoal, among other contested South China Sea features. Carlos, the head of the Philippine military\u2019s Western Command, or WESCOM, allegedly agreed with an unidentified Chinese official to a \u201cnew model\u201d for arranging for notifications of resupply missions to the Ayungin Shoal, according to a transcript released by the Chinese embassy to select news outlets. Last week, Philippine officials announced that Carlos had gone on leave and was temporarily replaced. Outpost in contested region Manila maintains the BRP Sierra Madre, an old ship grounded at the Ayungin Shoal, to serve as the country\u2019s outpost in the contested region. It is critical because the Ayungin lies near Mischief Reef, an artificial island where Beijing built a naval base in the 1990s. WESCOM oversees Manila\u2019s defense of the Palawan and Kalayaan islands, including the disputed Spratly chain. On Friday, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry hit back at the call from Eduardo A\u00f1o, the Philippine national security adviser, that Chinese embassy staffers be expelled. \u201cThe Philippines\u2019 response shows exactly their guilty conscience in the face of facts and evidence and how exasperated and desperate they have become,\u201d spokesman Lin Jian said during a regular press conference. \u201cWe ask the Philippines to ensure that Chinese diplomats can carry out their duty normally, and to stop provocations and infringements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Philippines needs to quit denying the facts and must not make reckless moves that will only backfire on the Philippines itself.\u201d Civilian mission Against the backdrop of this controversy, a civilian coalition, Atin Ito! (This Is Ours!), was preparing for a sea voyage this week where a convoy of boats would deliver supplies to Filipino fishermen at Scarborough Shoal, known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines. The shoal, located 125 nautical miles (232 km) from the west coast of Luzon \u2013 the largest of the Philippine islands \u2013 has effectively been under China\u2019s control since 2012 and despite a 2016 international arbitration ruling that dismissed Beijing\u2019s sweeping historical claims to most of the South China Sea. Filipino fishermen who venture out into the rich fishing ground at Scarborough Shoal are routinely harassed by the Chinese. Rafaela David, chief convenor of the Atin Ito! coalition, said they remained undeterred despite several recent incidents between Philippine and Chinese ships in the disputed waters. \u201cChina\u2019s actions are failing to intimidate Filipinos,\u201d David said in a statement. \u201cInstead, they are only uniting us and inspiring us to go further in defending our rights.\u201d Atin Ito! is a broad grouping of nationalist individuals and civilian organizations. It launched its first mission last December to deliver supplies and Christmas gifts to Filipino troops stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at the Second Thomas Shoal. That mission was forced to change its route and detour to less controversial parts of the disputed waterway. The convoy was subsequently forced to turn back to shore after four Chinese vessels started shadowing its lead ship. Preparing a blockade This week\u2019s convoy is scheduled to set sail for Scarborough Shoal on Wednesday morning from Masinloc town in Zambales province, a voyage that is expected to take two days. Ray Powell, who heads Stanford University\u2019s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation that monitors activities in the South China Sea, said on X that a huge Chinese force appeared to be preparing to intimidate the Filipino civilian mission. \u201cThis will be by far the largest blockade I\u2019ll have ever tracked at Scarborough,\u201d Powell said. The Filipino sea convoy will be escorted by the Philippine Coast Guard. Jonathan Malaya, assistant director general at the National Security Council, said Monday that the upcoming trip to Scarborough Shoal would be \u201ccivilian\u201d in nature. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure maritime safety. We need to make sure that our fellow Filipinos who are joining that trip and the foreign nationals that they have invited are safe because that mission is within our 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone,\u201d Malaya told a news briefing. \u201cThe objective of this mission is to help our fishermen in that part of the [West Philippine Sea] \u2013 that\u2019s why they are bringing supplies,\u201d Malaya said.",

This makes it highly risky for Ariel Henry to return. The international community's pressure on Henry to step down further complicates his return, as he may be considering his political future and safety.\n\nHowever, the involvement of the U.S. and U.N. in stabilizing Haiti and the potential deployment of a Kenyan-led security force could create conditions for his return. Additionally, Henry may feel compelled to return to address the crisis and maintain his political position.\n\nGiven the lack of an announced return date and the severe security concerns, the probability of Henry returning by March 13, 2024, seems low. However, the international efforts to stabilize the situation and the political necessity for Henry to address the crisis provide some counterbalance.\n\nOverall, the security risks and political pressure weigh more heavily against his return, but the international support and political necessity cannot be entirely discounted.\n</thinking>\n\n<cautious>\nThe sources may be biased or exaggerated due to the dramatic nature of the events and the focus on conflict and instability. Media coverage often emphasizes worst-case scenarios and immediate crises, which can skew perceptions of the likelihood of certain outcomes. Additionally, political actors may have incentives to portray the situation in a particular light to influence international opinion and intervention.\n\nGiven these potential biases, it is important to temper the assessment of the security situation and consider the possibility of rapid changes or improvements facilitated by international efforts. The involvement of the U.S. and U.N. suggests that there may be ongoing efforts to create conditions for Henry's safe return, which might not be fully captured in the current media narrative.\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.35\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of political leaders returning to their countries during crises. While the specific situation in Haiti is severe, political leaders often return to address crises, especially when international support is involved. The base rate for such returns might be higher than initially considered.\n\nAdditionally, the involvement of the U.S. and U.N. in stabilizing Haiti and the potential for rapid changes in the security situation should be factored in. The political necessity for Henry to address the crisis and maintain his position also increases the likelihood of his return.\n\nBalancing these considerations, the initial probability of 0.35 may be slightly conservative. Adjusting for the potential biases in the sources and the base rate of political leaders returning during crises, a revised probability is warranted.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n0.45\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti \u2014 The United States is urging Haiti\u2019s embattled prime minister to clear the way for the election of a new president, a position vacant since 2021, amid growing pressure from armed rebels at home and governments abroad. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters Wednesday that the U.S. government has asked Prime Minister Ariel Henry to \u201cmove forward on a political process that will lead to the establishment of a presidential transitional council that will lead to elections.\u201d As the armed gangs that control an estimated 80 percent of Haiti\u2019s capital called for Henry\u2019s ouster, the prime minister was having difficulty returning to the country. Henry, Haiti\u2019s top official since the still-unsolved July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse, visited Kenya last week to rally support for the deployment of a U.N.-approved, Kenya-led security force to Haiti, a key element in his plan to restore calm. Gangs lead mass prison break; Haiti declares state of emergency He was returning home Tuesday when the Dominican Republic, with which Haiti shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, denied his plane permission to land. He headed instead for Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. Advertisement On Tuesday, Caribbean diplomat Ronald Sanders told The Washington Post, Henry received a message from the U.S. State Department asking him to consider stepping down under certain conditions. Sanders, the ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States, said the message, which was described to him, included a statement that Henry could read when announcing his resignation. The 74-year-old physician, unelected and increasingly isolated, has declined so far to step down. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. Earlier in the day, spokesman Matthew Miller denied that the United States had urged Henry to resign. \u201cWe are not calling on him or pushing him to resign,\u201d Miller told reporters. \u201cBut we are urging him to expedite the transition to an empowered and an inclusive governance structure that will move with urgency to help the country prepare for a multinational security support mission to address the security situation and pave the way for free and fair elections.\u201d With Henry away, Haiti\u2019s gangs this week have dramatically escalated the violence in a country where security was already collapsing. An attack on the country\u2019s largest prison over the weekend allowed thousands of inmates to escape, prompting authorities to impose a 72-hour state of emergency and nighttime curfew. Advertisement The presidency remains vacant; lawmakers\u2019 terms have expired. That leaves Henry to lead the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Port-au-Prince and parts of the countryside are controlled by armed gangs who rape, kidnap and kill with impunity. The State Department on Wednesday urged U.S. citizens here to leave the country as soon as possible. Widow of Haiti's assassinated president accused in his killing Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang leader, Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, the former police officer known as \u201cBarbecue,\u201d this week gave Henry an ultimatum: Resign or \u201cthe country is headed straight to a genocide.\u201d \u201cIf the international community continues to support him, they are taking us to a civil war,\u201d Ch\u00e9rizier warned Tuesday. \u201cWe will fight until Ariel Henry\u2019s resignation.\u201d Caribbean leaders, seeing Henry as more hindrance than help, have also called on him to step down. On Tuesday, the Caribbean Community (Caricom) urged Henry to resign and proposed a timetable for next steps. Advertisement Henry was attempting to fly back to Haiti on Tuesday when he received a message from the State Department asking him to agree to a new transitional government and resign, the Miami Herald reported. Rebel leader who toppled Aristide sets sights on Haiti's current leader A Haitian politician who participated in discussions with Haitian leaders and Caricom said Henry\u2019s resignation is \u201cinevitable.\u201d Haitian and Caribbean leaders have suggested a two-headed transitional government in which a prime minister and presidential council would share power, according to the politician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Caricom leaders are increasingly arguing that there is no path forward with Henry as prime minister. \u201cIf it is clear that your time is up, both within the state and by the interested parties outside of the state, I don\u2019t know what the point of your hanging on is,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cParticularly when you are not even in the country and you\u2019re stuck in Puerto Rico with very little ability to get back to the country that you are supposed to be the prime minister of.\u201d Advertisement \u201cHe\u2019s in a very difficult position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a question of time.\u201d Henry has spoken of holding elections but has not called them. Haitian politicians have long discussed allowing Henry to remain as prime minister and share power with a presidential council. But other Haitian and Caribbean leaders have rejected the idea. It\u2019s unclear whether Henry is open to stepping down \u2014 \u201cor if that even matters,\u201d said Jake Johnston, author of \u201cAid State: Elite Panic, Disaster Capitalism and the Battle to Control Haiti.\u201d \u201cHenry\u2019s legitimacy comes from the international community, not from anybody in Haiti,\u201d said Johnston, a research associate who studies Haiti at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cIf the international community pulls that support, he can call himself whatever he wants, but does he actually exercise any real authority?\u201d Advertisement Given security conditions, it\u2019s unlikely that elections will be feasible in the short term. Johnston said a vote while Henry remained prime minister was never going to work. The international community, he said, should have stopped propping up Henry long ago. \u201cBy waiting as long as they did, by pushing this forward right to the brink, not only have Haitians paid with their lives but the resolution to the crisis has become that much more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the negotiations are taking place with both a literal and figurative gun to everyone\u2019s head.\u201d Kenyan court blocks deployment of police force to Haiti On Saturday night, heavily armed gangs attacked Haiti\u2019s two largest prisons, allowing thousands of inmates, including some of the nation\u2019s most notorious criminals, to escape. By Monday, gangs had burned down a police station near the airport and fired multiple shots at the airport itself. A police union reported attacks on several police stations throughout Port-au-Prince. Advertisement Water and food in the capital are scarce. Violence has trapped many residents in their homes and shut down most public hospitals. The University Hospital La Paix, one of the few still operating, is \u201coverwhelmed,\u201d its medical director, Jean Philippe Lerbourg, told The Post on Wednesday. Since Feb. 29, he said, La Paix has admitted 66 gunshot victims and dozens of patients with other wounds. Two of the gunshot victims have died. \u201cWe can\u2019t hold on much longer,\u201d Lerbourg said. \u201cWe\u2019re running low on blood, and we\u2019re short-staffed because many can\u2019t reach the hospital.\u201d",

Sheila Angler\u00f3 Mojica told CNN she did not have additional details on the matter but added that \u201cfederal agents from the CBP [US Customs and Border Protection] are in charge,\u201d without elaborating. Since last week, Port-au-Prince has been gripped by a wave of highly coordinated gang attacks on law enforcement and state institutions. Armed groups have burned down police stations and released thousands of inmates from two prisons, in what one gang leader described as an attempt to overthrow Henry\u2019s government. The violence erupted while Henry was in Kenya, where he signed an agreement underpinning a Kenyan-led mission of 1,000 police officers to Haiti to restore security in the Caribbean country. The prime minister\u2019s last appearance in public was in Kenya on Friday, before arriving today in Puerto Rico, per Mojica. Haiti\u2019s government declared a state of emergency on Sunday amid the spiraling violence in Port-au-Prince. The United Nations has said 15,000 people have been forced to flee from their homes in the capital, adding to the over 300,000 who had already been displaced by gang violence. The government cited the \u201cdeterioration of security,\u201d notably \u201cincreasingly violent criminal acts perpetrated by armed gangs,\u201d including kidnappings and killings of citizens, violence against women and children and looting, according to a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert. Gangs overpower police Port-au-Prince has been \u201chanded to the gangs\u201d who are continuing their assaults on police stations in the capital, Occil Francisco, a spokesperson for police union Synapoha told CNN Tuesday. At least eight police stations in Port-au-Prince \u201chave been lost\u201d in gang attacks, he said. The police academy, which holds more than 780 officers in training, was also under attack by men associated with gang leader Vitel\u2019Homme Innocent, he said. The police union is urging officials to reinforce the \u201coperational and reactive capacity\u201d of the national police force so they can provide security for civilians, he said. \u201cWe can say that our leadership has failed, and the police do not have the means to right this situation in Port-au-Prince,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment. The violence has prompted the Dominican Republic to suspend all cargo and passenger flights to and from neighboring Haiti. Dominican President Luis Abinader said Monday that a heightened level of security was in effect on his country\u2019s border with Haiti and that any escaped Haitian prisoner who tried to enter the country would face \u201ca drastic response.\u201d Aid groups are scrambling to help residents of the capital. Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), said it will scale up its activities in Port-au-Prince to care for the \u201cmounting number\u201d of injured people. \u201cThe violence has taken on a new dimension since last weekend, causing a massive number of casualties,\u201d MSF said in a statement Tuesday. The aid group has however struggled to provide care to Haitians, as the country\u2019s main port is now difficult to access and the international airport has been closed. \u201cWe fear we will run out of medicines and medical supplies, which are absolutely essential to meet the enormous needs we are facing at the moment,\u201d Haiti MSF head Mumuza Muhindo Musubah said in a statement.

(Washington Post & New York Times) Our Take Henry\u2019s inability to return to Haiti makes explicit and concrete what has been implicit and symbolic for more than two years: He is not in control of the country and is in no position to prevent it from sliding into anarchy. The events that have led to that becoming so irrefutable this week appear to have placed Haiti at a breaking point.

Henry was attempting to return home following a diplomatic mission in Nairobi to secure a Kenyan-led police force when he received the message from the U.S. State Department. The move represented a dramatic policy change for the Biden administration, which for months has pushed back against calls for Henry\u2019s resignation and instead proposed that he lead a political transition toward democratic elections. Henry took office in July 2021 after then-President Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination, and he has repeatedly delayed national elections since. Many Haitians reject Henry\u2019s legitimacy and argue that he did not have legal authority to sign off on the Kenyan-led police deployment, known as the MSS mission, because he is not an elected official. Last Thursday, gang leader Jimmy \u201cBarbecue\u201d Ch\u00e9rizier took advantage of Henry\u2019s absence to coordinate an armed assault calling for his ouster. \u201cIf Ariel Henry doesn\u2019t resign, if the international community continues to support him, we\u2019ll be heading straight for a civil war that will lead to genocide,\u201d Ch\u00e9rizier said on Tuesday. \u201cEither Haiti becomes a paradise or a hell for all of us.\u201d The government in Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u2019s capital, issued a 72-hour state of emergency and curfew on Sunday after gangs freed around 3,700 inmates from two major prisons, stormed numerous police stations, and killed multiple police officers. Since then, gangs have surrounded Toussaint Louverture International Airport, preventing Henry from safely landing in Port-au-Prince. After he signed the police deployment agreement with Kenyan President William Ruto in Nairobi on Friday, Henry\u2019s whereabouts were publicly unknown until late Tuesday, when he showed up in Puerto Rico. The Miami Herald reports that the Haitian leader had flown to the United States after his weekend Kenya trip. Unable to fly back to Haiti safely, Henry secretly negotiated a plan with diplomats from the Dominican Republic to help Henry stealthily cross the border into Haiti. However, after Henry\u2019s flight departed the United States en route to the Dominican Republic, the country decided at the last minute not to allow his plane clearance to land. Henry then diverted to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico; while on his way there, he received the message from the U.S. State Department urging him to resign. Henry landed safely in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he remains. \u201cOur support is focused on helping the [Haitian National Police] restore security, expediting the deployment of the MSS mission, and accelerating a peaceful transition of power via free and fair elections,\u201d a U.S. National Security Council official said on Tuesday night. \u201cOur dialogue with Prime Minister Henry has been focused on these efforts and the need for security and a peaceful political transition.\u201d Almost 40 percent of Haiti\u2019s 11.7 million residents face acute hunger, according to the World Food Program. And since last Thursday, around 15,000 people, mainly women and children, have been forced to flee their homes in Port-au-Prince, adding to the more than 300,000 people already displaced by gang violence last year. The United Nations Security Council held a closed-door emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the worsening security crisis. \u201cWho is in control? I think nobody is in control,\u201d said Jean-Marc Biquet, head of the Doctors Without Borders mission in Haiti, adding that if the police give up fighting, it\u2019s a lost battle. \u201cThen what can happen? Well, I guess, total chaos.\u201d Today\u2019s Most Read Milei\u2019s Austerity Is Devastating Argentina by Lautaro Grinspan NATO Should Not Accept Ukraine\u2014for Ukraine\u2019s Sake by Stephen M. Walt The Big Lesson From the West\u2019s Last Invasion of Russia by Theodore Bunzel What We\u2019re Following War crimes accusations. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on Tuesday for two senior Russian commanders. The court accused Army Lt. Gen. Sergey Kobylash and Navy Adm. Viktor Sokolov of war crimes, including targeting civilian objects and incidental harm of civilians. The men are believed to be responsible for numerous strikes on Ukrainian power plants between October 2022 and March 2023. Moscow dismissed the allegations on Wednesday as having no legal significance; Russia is not party to the court\u2019s Rome Statute. \u201cEvery Russian commander who orders strikes against Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure must know that justice will be served,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X, formerly Twitter, following the ICC announcement. This is the second time that the court has issued arrest warrants against top Russian leaders related to this conflict. In March 2023, the ICC targeted President Vladimir Putin and Children\u2019s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for their involvement in the forcible removal of Ukrainian children to Russia, which is considered a war crime. Growth targets revealed. Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced an ambitious yet unsurprising economic growth target of around 5 percent for 2024 at the annual National People\u2019s Congress on Tuesday. Amid worrying deflation and a struggling property sector, Li touted Chinese stability. He unveiled a 7.2 percent increase in Beijing\u2019s military budget, the same as last year, and promised to target big-ticket spending, such as on electronics and automobiles. The roughly 5 percent goal is similar to 2023\u2019s target. Presumptive Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto also announced new economic goals on Tuesday. He vowed to focus on privatization once he takes office as well as accelerate growth by 8 percent within the next five years. Prabowo is expected to win the country\u2019s presidential election, with official results to be announced later this month. Indonesia is Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and has positioned itself as a key part in global supply chains for electric vehicles. Gaza aid deliveries. Washington airdropped additional humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in its second such operation within a week. The U.S. Air Force dropped 36,800 ready-to-eat meals in coordination with the Jordanian Air Force, adding to the roughly 38,000 meals that Washington dropped last Saturday. U.S. officials reiterated that there are currently no plans to deploy troops to the area. The U.S. decision came amid rising concerns over acute hunger in Gaza, with the U.N. warning late last month that a quarter of the enclave\u2019s 2.3 million residents risk imminent starvation. Yet humanitarian officials say that these meals are not enough to address the problem. \u201cThe three planeloads that the U.S. dropped last week are equivalent to ballpark four to six truckloads\u201d of aid, Refugees International President Jeremy Konyndyk told NPR. \u201cSo it really is not a significant additional amount of aid relative to the already hugely inadequate amount that\u2019s getting in.\u201d Odds and Ends",

          "raw_content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Haiti is entering its second day of a state of emergency, after gangs attacked the capital city's most important prisons over the weekend, releasing thousands of inmates. The country's airport is under siege, and on Monday evening, it was still not clear whether Haiti's de facto prime minister had made it back into the country. Monique Clesca, a well-known activist in Haiti, says the weekend represented \"three days of terror.\" \"Gangs paraded throughout Port-au-Prince with their arms openly,\" she told NPR. \"It wasn't done at night and the police was nowhere to be found.\" Almost three years after the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse, Haiti has been in free-fall. Elections haven't been held since 2017, so the term for every elected official has expired; security services are overwhelmed and millions are going hungry. Here are three things you should know about this latest bout of violence in the country. It marks the overt involvement of gangs in politics Robert Fatton, who studies Haiti at the University of Virginia, says other bouts of violence in Haiti were marked by fights between gangs. This time, he says, the gangs in Haiti have forged an alliance and at least one of the big gang leaders, Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, who is nicknamed Barbecue, has said explicitly that the point of this violence is to overthrow the government. Fatton says working together, the gangs have flexed a powerful muscle. They already controlled most of the capital city, but over the past week, they shot at airplanes at the international airport in Port-au-Prince. International airlines stopped their flights, something that rarely happened in the past. The gangs also overpowered police at two of the main prisons and managed to release thousands of inmates. This is a critical moment for Haiti, Fatton says. \"The situation is on the verge of a real collapse of any and every institution that remains in the country,\" he says. In other words, he says, there is a possibility the gangs could become the dominant force in Haiti. Haiti's de facto prime minister is not in the country Haiti's de facto Prime Minister Ariel Henry traveled to Kenya last week. Last year, the East African country agreed to lead a multinational force in Haiti, but Kenyan courts have delayed the deployment. Henry was in the country trying to close that deal. When the violence broke out, it was Patrick Boisvert, the country's finance minister who was acting as prime minister, who signed the emergency declaration. At a press briefing, the U.S. State Department said Henry was \"returning to the country.\" \"We think it's important that he do so and that he be allowed to do so,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, declining to say more. On Tuesday night, however, several news outlets were reporting that Henry had touched down in Puerto Rico. Citing tracking data, The Associated Press reported that Henry's flight had originated in New Jersey and was heading toward Dominican Republic, which shares with Haiti the island of Hispaniola. His plane circled mid-flight before diverting to Puerto Rico. Kenyan police are still seen as the way out of this crisis Speaking to reporters the State Department's Miller said the crisis \"underscores the urgency\" of finalizing the Kenyan-led mission. Clesca, who was part of a civil society group that has promoted a holistic approach to ending the Haitian crisis, says part of the problem is that Prime Minister Henry has been solely focused on a military solution. Henry, she says, could have ordered a state of emergency from the time he came to power, allowing the police to bring the gangs under control and at the same time plan for elections. \"Instead, a few months after [he came to power], he went to the United Nations and said 'send me some troops' and then crossed his arms,\" Clesca says. \"And that's all they did \u2014 wait and wait and wait.\" On Friday, Henry and Kenyan President William Ruto witnessed the signing of a bilateral agreement authorizing the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti. Kenya's government believes the agreement satisfies the objections of the Kenyan courts, which had stopped the deployment. \"It is a mission for humanity,\" Ruto said. \"It is a mission in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Haiti.\" Ruto said the signing of the agreement was the \"final step\" and that his police force would \"be there at the earliest opportunity that is possible.\"",

          "raw_content": "Gangs aiming to oust Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry wreaked havoc in the capital Port-au-Prince Friday, March 1, as gun attacks near the city's international airport and a prison marked a second day of extreme violence. At least four police officers were killed Thursday and dozens have been wounded since the latest spate of brutality began, with Henry meanwhile in Kenya mustering support for a UN-backed international police deployment. Armed gangs have taken over entire swaths of the country in recent years, unleashing extreme violence that has left the Haitian economy and public health system in tatters. The latest attacks are part of a coordinated effort by gangs, united under the label \"Vivre Ensemble\" (\"Living Together\"). Powerful gang leader Jimmy Cherisier, known by the nickname Barbecue, said in a video posted on social media before the violence began that the armed groups were acting in concert \"to get Prime Minister Ariel Henry to step down.\" Henry on Friday was in Nairobi signing a \"reciprocal\" agreement with Kenya which will deploy police to lead a UN-backed law and order mission to the troubled Caribbean nation. Streets blocked by barricades of burning ties Back in Haiti, approximately 10 police officers protested in front of management offices Friday, demanding recovery of the bodies of their four slain colleagues. Streets across Port-au-Prince meanwhile were blocked by barricades of burning ties. The State University Hospital of Haiti, one of the largest public hospitals in the capital, received at least 25 wounded people Thursday, according to a source. At two facilities run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the Tabarre and Cit\u00e9 Soleil districts the number of patients remained the same as normal \u2013 approximately 15 per day.

(Strength: 6)\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n- GameStop's recent stock surges and the influence of retail investors could continue to drive its market capitalization higher in the short term. (Strength: 7)\n- GameStop's ability to raise significant capital through share sales during rallies indicates strong investor interest and potential for further price increases. (Strength: 6)\n- DocuSign's recent earnings announcement disappointed some investors, which could negatively impact its stock price in the short term. (Strength: 5)\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe key factors to consider are the volatility and meme stock dynamics affecting GameStop versus the more stable and consistent financial performance of DocuSign. GameStop's market capitalization has been highly influenced by retail investor sentiment and specific events, which can lead to rapid and unpredictable changes. On the other hand, DocuSign's financial performance and strategic initiatives suggest a more stable and potentially increasing market capitalization.\n\nWhile GameStop's recent surges could continue in the short term, the sustainability of these increases is uncertain. DocuSign's consistent revenue growth and strong underlying earnings potential provide a more stable foundation for its market capitalization. Additionally, DocuSign's share repurchase program could positively impact its stock price by reducing the number of outstanding shares.\n\nGiven the current market capitalizations are very close, the volatility of GameStop's stock introduces significant uncertainty. However, the stability and financial performance of DocuSign suggest a slight edge in maintaining or increasing its market capitalization relative to GameStop.\n</thinking>\n\n<cautious>\nThe sources may be biased or exaggerated due to the nature of meme stock phenomena and the influence of retail investors on GameStop's stock price. Media coverage of Keith Gill's activities and the meme stock trend can amplify the perceived impact on GameStop's market capitalization, leading to overestimation of its sustainability. Additionally, the volatility associated with meme stocks introduces significant uncertainty, making it challenging to predict long-term outcomes based on short-term events.\n\nDocuSign's financial performance and strategic initiatives are more grounded in consistent business operations and market trends, reducing the likelihood of exaggerated impacts. However, investor sentiment and market reactions to earnings announcements can still introduce some bias in short-term stock price movements.\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.55\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rates and the specific context of the companies involved. GameStop's market capitalization has been highly volatile due to meme stock dynamics, which introduces significant uncertainty. DocuSign's consistent financial performance and strategic initiatives provide a more stable foundation for its market capitalization.\n\nGiven the close market capitalizations as of June 18, 2024, and the factors influencing each company's stock price, the initial probability of 0.55 seems reasonable. However, considering the potential for continued meme stock volatility and the stability of DocuSign's financial performance, a slight adjustment may be warranted to account for the higher uncertainty associated with GameStop.\n\nFinal probability: 0.52\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.52*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "GameStop (GME) stock surged 21% on Monday after user \"DeepF***ingValue, an account believed to be tied to individual investor Keith Gill \u2014 who ignited the meme stock rally back in 2021 \u2014 posted a screenshot on Reddit late Sunday that purported to show they paid nearly $175 million building a position in the video game retailer. GameStop gained as much as 75% at the market open before paring gains throughout the session. Shares closed at $28 each on Monday. Gill is also known as Roaring Kitty on X and YouTube. The user posted the screenshot Sunday night on Reddit's Superstonk subreddit. The screenshot showed holdings of 5 million GameStop shares purchased at an average price of $21.274, a position worth $115.7 million as of Friday's closing price of $23.14. GameStop shares traded hands at $38 each in early trading Monday before they were temporarily halted for volatility. The account also appears to own 120,000 options contracts that expire on June 21. These contracts confer the right to buy GameStop shares at $20 each, a position worth $65.7 million as of Friday's close. Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers chief strategist, warned investors against chasing the rally. \"Is whoever controlling this account doing this in your best interest or in their best interest? And, really, you should think that one through because, to me, it [is] pretty obvious whose interest it's in,\" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance on Monday. \"If you're chasing the stock up here, you're more likely than not the source of liquidity for whoever is controlling this account to sell into your enthusiasm.\" Monday's surge comes after GameStop rallied 180% over a span of two days back in mid-May after \"Roaring Kitty\" posted for the first time on X, formerly known as Twitter, since 2021. Last month's rally was short-lived, as analysts warned the meme action this time around was a far cry from the level of retail inflows seen in 2021. Still, GameStop capitalized on May's rally. Last month, the company sold 45 million shares, bringing in around $930 million in proceeds. The stock surged 25% on the news. Typically, investors would expect the stock price of a company issuing new shares \u2014 which dilute the value of current holdings \u2014 to decline after a stock sale. AMC (AMC) also capitalized on the meme frenzy, raising $250 million through the sale of 72.5 million shares last month. AMC shares gained 11% to close at $4.81 each on Monday.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics.\" Operational and Other Financial Highlights: Launches Docusign IAM (\"Intelligent Agreement Management\"): Docusign announced a significant expansion of its company strategy at its Momentum24 NYC conference. Docusign IAM is a platform with services that transforms how customers create, commit, and manage agreements. Services include: Docusign Maestro: Automate and accelerate agreement creation and processes through flexible, customizable workflows without using code. Maestro integrates Docusign products, including eSignature, ID verification, and data verification, with third-party applications. Docusign Navigator: A smart repository that enables organizations to centrally store, manage, and analyze agreements from any source. Powered by Docusign AI, Navigator transforms unstructured agreements into structured data, making it easy for users to find agreements, access vital information, and gain valuable insights from agreements. Docusign App Center: Customers can discover, install, and connect third-party applications to integrate their existing systems with IAM. At launch, App Center will feature an initial set of commonly used apps, including HubSpot, ServiceNow, Stripe, and document-sharing services like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft Sharepoint. IAM application suites: The IAM platform will be offered through purpose-built applications for specific functions within organizations. With the initial Q2 IAM launch, Docusign will offer IAM for Sales, IAM for Customer Experience, and IAM Core. Future application suites will include IAM for Legal, IAM for Procurement, IAM for Human Resources, and other solutions for functions and industry verticals. Subsequent to the end of Q1, Docusign announced in late May the general availability of IAM for an initial set of customers. From that point, IAM will gradually roll out across customer segments and geographies. AI Innovation Leadership: Lexion Acquisition: After Q1, Docusign closed its acquisition of DocuSmart, Inc. d/b/a Lexion (\"Lexion\"). Lexion is a leader in AI-based agreement technology with solutions designed to automate workflows and extract vital information from contracts. Founded in 2019, Lexion accelerates Docusign's AI-powered IAM roadmap and brings industry leaders into its technology teams. AI Momentum24 Announcements: Docusign announced the launch of AI-powered Agreement Summarization in Docusign CLM, enabling the creation of concise summaries of large amounts of agreement text. Docusign is also one of the first integrations with Microsoft Copilot for Sales, giving sellers using Microsoft Dynamics or Salesforce Sales Cloud the power to surface and instantly access agreement data relevant to a CRM record. Increase to Stock Repurchase Program Docusign's board of directors has authorized an increase to its existing stock repurchase program for an additional amount of up to $1.0 billion of Docusign's outstanding common stock. The program has no minimum purchase commitment and no mandated end date. The repurchase is expected to be executed, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, and other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The timing and the amount of any repurchased common stock will be determined by Docusign's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate Docusign to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at Docusign's discretion without prior notice. Guidance The company currently expects the following guidance: Quarter ending July 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages): Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2025 (in millions, except percentages): A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP guidance measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, expenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are impacted by many factors, including the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP financial results included in this release. Webcast Conference Call Information The company will host a conference call on June 6, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) to discuss its financial results.

          "raw_content": "GameStop shares surged Friday after Keith Gill, whose relentless cheerleading under his online handle \"Roaring Kitty\" has spurred retail investors to back the struggling video game chain, revealed plans to appear on YouTube for the first time in three years. The Roaring Kitty YouTube channel, which has more than 700,000 subscribers, revealed that Gill has scheduled a June 7 livestream. The post sent GameStop's stock price, which trades under the ticker symbol \"GME,\" rocketing up 47% on the day to $47.55. GameStop's stock also spiked three weeks ago when Gill initially resurfaced online after a long hiatus, posting a cryptic image on X of a sketched man leaning forward in a chair. As Roaring Kitty, Gill posted videos on YouTube during the pandemic \u2014 at a time when Americans were stuck indoors, leading some to try their hands at investing. But Gill largely vanished from the retail investor scene in 2021 after testifying before Congress about the \"meme stock\" craze. Fur in the game Gill, a financial analyst turned social media influencer, certainly appears to have some fur in the game. Earlier this month, he posted a screenshot in a Reddit forum showing that Gill's holding in GameStop shares topped $115 million \u2014 a stake that would be even larger given the latest upturn in the stock. Gill's return to social media has also propelled gains in other downtrodden stocks embraced by amateur investors, including AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. Yet Gill's rabid social media following is also attracting scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that E*Trade was considering booting Gill from the trading platform because of concerns about possible stock manipulation related to his GameStop activities. Before Gill's rise to popularity, GameStop had experienced declining sales amid an industrywide pivot from game cartridges to video game streaming and digital downloads. But with the help from meme stock investors, the company in March turned its first profit in two years. GameStop said in a regulatory filing last month that it sold a new batch of 45 million shares, generating more than $933 million in fresh capital. Prior to March, GameStop had posted seven straight quarterly losses. In January, the company reported its first annual profit since 2018. The company appointed Ryan Cohen, the billionaire founder of online pet supplies company Chewy, as its new CEO last September. As of February, GameStop had 4,169 locations, including 2,915 in the U.S.",

Our analysis says that investors should be optimistic, as the strong profit is built on solid foundations. Zooming In On DocuSign's Earnings In high finance, the key ratio used to measure how well a company converts reported profits into free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio (from cashflow). To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period. This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow. That means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking. For the year to April 2024, DocuSign had an accrual ratio of -6.86. That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$905m in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$107.2m. DocuSign shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months. However, that's not all there is to consider. The accrual ratio is reflecting the impact of unusual items on statutory profit, at least in part. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? DocuSign's profit was reduced by unusual items worth US$31m in the last twelve months, and this helped it produce high cash conversion, as reflected by its unusual items. This is what you'd expect to see where a company has a non-cash charge reducing paper profits. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If DocuSign doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year. Our Take On DocuSign's Profit Performance Considering both DocuSign's accrual ratio and its unusual items, we think its statutory earnings are unlikely to exaggerate the company's underlying earnings power. Based on these factors, we think DocuSign's underlying earnings potential is as good as, or probably even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem! So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing DocuSign at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found and you'll want to know about it. After our examination into the nature of DocuSign's profit, we've come away optimistic for the company. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

The successful Law School commencement suggests that UCLA can hold events under current conditions, but the broader context of ongoing protests and the precedent set by other universities canceling their ceremonies weigh heavily against this.\n\nThe establishment of a new Office of Campus Safety and enhanced security measures could mitigate some risks, but the persistent unrest and significant disruptions on campus, including the cancellation of in-person classes, indicate a volatile environment. The criticism faced by Chancellor Gene Block and the pressure to avoid further controversy may also influence the decision to cancel the ceremony.\n\nGiven the high level of unrest and the actions taken by other universities, the likelihood of UCLA canceling its main commencement ceremony appears significant.

Media coverage often emphasizes dramatic events, potentially overstating the likelihood of further disruptions. Additionally, the successful holding of the Law School commencement suggests that the university can manage such events despite the protests, which may not be fully reflected in the media narrative.\n\nConsidering these potential biases, the probability of UCLA holding its main commencement ceremony might be higher than initially assessed. The university's proactive measures and recent successful event management should be given more weight in the final assessment.\n\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.35\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is essential to consider the base rate of universities canceling commencement ceremonies due to protests, which is relatively low. The specific context of ongoing protests and the actions of other universities provide strong case-specific information, but the successful management of the Law School commencement and the new safety measures at UCLA suggest a more balanced view.\n\nGiven the potential media bias and the university's demonstrated capability to hold events under challenging conditions, the final probability should be adjusted slightly higher. The base rate of cancellations, combined with the specific mitigating factors at UCLA, leads to a more moderate forecast.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.45*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "UCLA Law School\u2019s celebrated its 73rd commencement on Friday, May 10, the first since unrest erupted at the campus earlier this month in major clashes and protests over the war in Gaza and a growing outcry over the university\u2019s response. But the historic turmoil on the Westwood campus appeared to be set aside, at least for the moment, inside the school\u2019s iconic Pauley Pavilion, as long lines of smiling law school graduates, clad in black robe and caps, filed in for the ceremony. (Members of the media were not allowed into the event, but the ceremony was livecast on YouTube.) Dozens of graduates wore keffiyeh, a black-and-white shawl that symbolizes Palestinian people\u2019s yearning for freedom, over their commencement robes, visible as they sifted in to a recording of \u201cPomp and Circumstance.\u201d The event itself had moved from its traditional spot, at Dickson Court near the law school, to Pauley in early May, amid campus tensions. But those tensions turned to smiles of students, as they waved and pointed out to cheering loved ones and supporters in the arena\u2019s seats. While the pomp and the circumstance were still in the air, so was tightened security, inside and out. And so was the fresh memory of the past two weeks. The tone at Pauley Friday belied a chaotic scene not far away in the pre-dawn hours of May 2, when waves of police, clad in riot gear and using flash bangs, pushed through lines of arms-linked protesters to clear a large pro-Palestinian encampment in the heart of the campus: Royce Quad. Amid the sweep, 200 were arrested. A day before the crackdown, a violent clash between counter protesters and occupants of the tent city stunned a campus already steeped in simmering tensions. In the days following, security was heightened and in-person classes were forced online. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block faced intense criticism for the university\u2019s response. Even as the law school graduation commenced, the university\u2019s Academic Senate was set to meet in a special session the same afternoon to decide whether to censure Block for failing \u201cto ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events of last week.\u201d Just Wednesday, University of California faculty and staff called for his resignation. It was clear, none of that recent past was lost on anyone. \u201cThis has been a really hard time,\u201d Dean Michael Waterstone, in his first year at the helm of the law school, told the crowd. He emphasized that the graduation should be a joyful, memorable occasion, but acknowledged it was happening in a \u201ccharged moment.\u201d Waterstone cautioned against outbursts during the ceremony, deferring to the right to free speech, but said loud disruptors would be asked to stop, to preserve the special moment for graduates. The dean, who attended UCLA as an undergraduate, said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything like this\u201d in his time at the university. \u201cI thought about what to say or whether to say anything at all.\u201d But, he added that the current period of darkness will ultimately lead to a renewed light, including celebrating Friday\u2019s law graduates, who came from the law school\u2019s multiple degree programs. A small turf area across from Pauley Pavilion was marked with signs that \u201cfree speech zone\u201d across from Pauley Pavilion on Friday, not specifically in case of pro-Palestinian protests, campus safety aides said. The space remained empty ahead of and during the ceremony. Two attendees, who donned the shawls and pieces of fabric pinned to their shirts that read \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d left the commencement early, but said that there were no demonstrations or acts of solidarity happening while they were inside. A UCLA political science major who was graduating during the main commencement ceremonies in June, said that she doubted anything would break out at Friday\u2019s ceremony because of high security and the event being ticketed. The class of 2024 student was involved in the recent campus protests, she said, including participating in a walkout and bringing food and other supplies to students who were in the encampments. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d she added, \u201cto see how our institution\u2019s reacting by taking away classes and (other colleges cancelling) graduations.\u201d She already lost her high school graduation in 2020 because of COVID, she said, and hopes to be able to walk the stage next month to get her undergraduate degree. The attendees declined to give names, citing privacy and security reasons. UCLA Law\u2019s commencement on Friday came amid a backdrop of continued campus unrest in Southern California and across the nation since some 1,200 people were killed in Israel and 253 taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. The ensuing war has left 35,000 people dead in Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities, and displaced huge numbers of people in the region. Across Southern California, from USC to Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties, demonstrations large and small have continued, fueled by demands for a cease-fire in Gaza and that schools divest from entities that do business with Israel. Back at UCLA on Friday, it was all about student achievement, the concluding of school days and the future. There were references to what many of the students have been through, ranging from the pandemic to social unrest. Many remained mindful of the moment. That awareness came through, perhaps, even in the words from the event\u2019s speakers. \u201cWhen we come together, as all of us have here, we build friendships that nurture communities and forge solidarities,\u201d graduation student speaker Shreyashi Sharma told the crowd, as she spoke of the power of social bonds to transform laws and societies. \u201cOur solidarities traverse our individual identities, geographic values and cultural and political differences.\u201d Staff writer Lisa Jacobs contributed to this report",

          "raw_content": "The University of Southern California said on Thursday it has called off its main-stage graduation ceremony this year, one week after canceling the valedictorian speech by a Muslim student who said she was silenced by anti-Palestinian hatred. New safety measures in place this year, such as additional screening procedures, will increase the processing time for guests \u201csubstantially,\u201d according to an update on USC\u2019s website. \u201cAs a result, we will not be able to host the main stage ceremony that traditionally brings 65,000 students, families, and friends to our campus all at the same time,\u201d the update said. The announcement came as a pro-Palestine encampment appeared across town in Los Angeles on the UCLA campus. By mid-morning, several dozen protesters were sitting and milling around inside the encampment outside Royce Hall, with dozens of tents being erected and more protesters gathering. The Israel-Gaza war has sparked tensions on U.S. college campuses and inspired a wave of students and outsiders to erect protest encampments at universities across the country in recent days. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested, including more than 90 at USC on Wednesday. Rights groups have viewed the arrests with concern as a free speech issue, while university officials have said the protests have been unauthorized. USC\u2019s decision to abandon the main commencement ceremony came days after the university announced it had \u201cdecided it is best to release our outside speakers and honorees\u201d from attending the commencement ceremony, following the outcry over the decision to cancel the valedictorian\u2019s speech. USC Provost Andrew Guzman said in a statement last week that the decision to cancel the speech of the Muslim valedictorian, biomedical engineering major Asna Tabassum, was aimed at protecting campus security and \u201chad nothing to do with free speech.\u201d Guzman\u2019s statement did not refer to Tabassum by name, or specify what about her speech, background or political views had raised concerns, nor did it detail any particular threats. Trojans for Israel, a USC-based group, and We Are Tov (Hebrew for \u201cgood\u201d), a group advocating support for Israel and Jews in collegiate life, called for Tabassum\u2019s removal, saying she has previously espoused antisemitic views. According to Tabassum, who described herself as a \u201cfirst-generation South Asian-American Muslim,\u201d USC officials refused to share details of the university\u2019s security assessment.

All classes will be held remotely through Friday, May 10. The campus sent out and alert saying, \"Law enforcement is stationed around campus to help promote safety and actively monitor conditions. The hospital and health system, other clinical operations, and housing and hospitality facilities remain open.\" The statement also said Law School exams will continue as scheduled. Earlier on Monday, a group of 50 to 60 people were arrested inside Moore Hall after staging an apparent sit-in. It's unclear whether they were students. The school sent out an alert saying, \"Classes and work in Moore Hall will be remote today [Monday] due to ongoing disruptions. Law enforcement is stationed around campus to help promote safety. Student Affairs has staff on campus to support our students.\" Authorities also detained a group of people inside a parking garage. RELATED: Multiple people arrested inside UCLA parking garage and Moore Hall This comes after Chancellor Gene Block announced a newly created Office of Campus Safety to help administer policing and emergency management in the aftermath of campus unrest over pro-Palestinian demonstrations. RELATED: UCLA cancels classes after violence erupts on campus between protest groups Last week, UCLA was criticized for its response to the violence that broke out at a protest encampment last week. Gov. Gavin Newsom and other elected officials responded, calling for investigations into the university's reaction, and some critics even calling on Block to resign ahead of his previously announced plan to step down on July 31. \"In the past week, our campus has been shaken by events that have disturbed this sense of safety and strained trust within our community,\" Block said in a message to the UCLA community Sunday. \"In light of this, both UCLA and the UC Office of the President have committed to a thorough investigation of our security processes. But one thing is already clear: To best protect our community moving forward, urgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations. RELATED: Violence erupts at UCLA as pro-Palestinian protesters, counter-protesters clash Block continued to say he is taking several actions to significantly alter campus safety structure. \"Effective immediately, I am moving oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety, whose leader reports directly to me. It is clear that UCLA needs a unit and leader whose sole responsibility is campus safety to guide us through tense times,\" said Block Leading the new office as its inaugural associate vice chancellor will be Rick Braziel, who'll bring more than 30 years of public safety service to the job, including five years as chief of police for the city of Sacramento. Braziel has also served as an instructor in community policing and has led reviews of law enforcement agencies and police responses. Block is also creating a formal advisory group whose members include UC Davis Chief of Police and Coordinator of the Council of UC Chiefs of Police Joe Farrow, professor of psychology and of health policy and management Vickie Mays and UC Office of the President Systemwide Director of Community Safety Jody Stiger. RELATED: Over 200 people arrested at pro-Palestinian encampment on UCLA campus Police moved in and cleared the weeklong pro-Palestinian encampment early Thursday, arresting 209 people. Most of those arrested were booked on suspicion of unlawful assembly, then released from custody with instructions to appear in court at a later date. No significant injuries to protesters or the hundreds of police officers who took part in the raid were reported. Disputes between protesters at the encampment peaked overnight Tuesday and early Wednesday, when the pro-Palestinian encampment was attacked by counter-protesters supporting Israel who set of fireworks and allegedly deployed pepper spray or bear repellent. The violence prompted a cancellation of all classed at UCLA on Wednesday. RELATED: UCLA cancels classes after violence erupts on campus between protest groups The clearing of the encampment gave a broader picture of the amount of damage done to the campus.

          "raw_content": "The student encampments to protest the Gaza war started April 17 at Columbia University, where Tuesday night New York City police stormed an occupied building and arrested more than 100 pro-Palestinian protesters. The movement quickly spread to California campuses. At the University of Southern California, Los Angeles police arrested nearly 100 protestors last week and the university canceled its main commencement ceremony. The protest prompted California U.S. Senate hopeful Steve Garvey to say that \u201cdemonstrations that allow people to build encampments\u2026 is terrorism.\u201d After weeklong demonstrations at Cal Poly Humboldt led administrators to close the campus, 100 officers arrested at least 32 protestors Tuesday. Demonstrators occupied buildings, and were told by police that they \u201ccould face rubber bullets and chemical spray,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times, though no injuries were reported. Then at UCLA, the university Tuesday night declared a \u201cPalestine solidarity encampment\u201d illegal. Soon after, violent clashes involving fireworks and pepper spray broke out between the pro-Palestinian demonstrators and pro-Israel counter-protesters. In the aftermath, 15 people were injured and all classes were canceled Wednesday. Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed California Highway Patrol officers to the campus early Wednesday morning. Newsom, in a statement: \u201cThe law is clear: The right to free speech does not extend to inciting violence, vandalism, or lawlessness on campus. Those who engage in illegal behavior must be held accountable for their actions \u2014 including through criminal prosecution, suspension, or expulsion.\u201d Early today, police tore down the encampment, fired projectiles and arrested protesters. And President Biden addressed the campus protests this morning, saying from the White House that while peaceful protest is part of America\u2019s tradition, violence, disruption of classes and commencements and hate speech are not. Until the violence at UCLA, one reason why many University of California campuses were calmer is because of policing changes made after the George Floyd demonstrations in 2020, explains Atmika Iyer of CalMatters\u2019 College Journalism Network. To curb potential violence on campus, UC President Michael Drake released the UC Campus Safety Plan in 2021, which included guidelines to \u201cminimize police presence at protests, follow de-escalation methods in the event of violence and seek non-urgent mutual aid first from UC campuses before calling outside law enforcement agencies.\u201d But haphazard adherence to these guidelines is partly the reason, writes Atmika, that law enforcement officials failed to take action and to stop the escalating violence at UCLA. And with protest encampments cropping up on at least five other UC campuses, the updated safety plan has come under scrutiny. Drake himself has ordered an independent review of UCLA\u2019s \u201cmutual aid response.\u201d Strong reactions to UCLA\u2019s response have come from all sides of the issue. The California Federation of Teachers and some lecturers called for UCLA Chancellor Gene Block to resign immediately for \u201chis failure of leadership.\u201d (He is set to retire July 31 and has been summoned to testify to Congress about campus antisemitism.) Leaders of the Legislative Jewish Caucus said Wednesday they were \u201cappalled\u201d by what they called the \u201ctotal failure\u201d of UCLA\u2019s leadership in protecting Jewish students. They also condemned the assaults on pro-Palestinian students. The statement: \u201cThe violent actions of a few agitators does not represent our community and is antithetical to our Jewish values.\u201d Meanwhile, legislative Republican leaders plan today to call for budget actions \u201cto reduce funding to help restore order on state college and university campuses and hold school administrations accountable for doing nothing to protect student safety and ensure lawful conduct.\u201d Learn more about the campus protests in Atmika\u2019s story. Last week, the Assembly passed a bill that would allow candidates and elected officials to use more campaign funds for personal security for themselves, family members and staff. As the proposal awaits the Senate, CalMatters Capitol reporter Sameea Kamal dives into why its author is doubling down after Gov. Newsom vetoed similar legislation last year. Assemblymember Mia Bonta told Sameea that her own experience, as well as what local candidates and fellow legislators have faced, proves the need for the bill. Bonta, an Oakland Democrat: \u201cI\u2019ve had an instance of being on my front lawn, and having somebody text me from an unknown number to say that I looked really good on my lawn. Those are all things that make us, just, not feel very safe.\u201d A report from the University of San Diego found that of 328 local elected officials surveyed, 75% reported being threatened or harassed \u2014 with female officials being disproportionately targeted. Last spring, Democratic Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Culver City said he received a letter calling for him to be lynched after he proposed a bill to change how ballot measures are presented to voters. When Newsom vetoed Bonta\u2019s proposal in 2023, he said the bill did not \u201cclearly define \u2018security expenses\u2019\u201d and could lead to \u201cexpenditures far beyond\u201d what donors expect. This year\u2019s bill clarifies what can be considered a security expense (funds can\u2019t be used for firearms, for example) and also requires officials to keep detailed records. For more about the bill, read Sameea\u2019s story. In other election news: Recount complete: After all the votes were tallied a second time in the 16th Congressional District, Assemblymember Evan Low edged Santa Clara Supervisor Joe Simitian by five votes and advanced to the November election. In the March 5 primary, Low and Simitian tied for second with exactly 30,249 votes each, behind former San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. But a voter, who has some ties to Liccardo, requested a recount and agreed to pay for it, with help from a super PAC. Low tried to stop the recount. But with Santa Clara County finishing on Tuesday and San Mateo wrapping up on Wednesday, Low gained 12 votes and Simitian added 7. A new super PAC: Battleground California announced Wednesday it will spend $15 million in eight competitive congressional districts in the state to help Democrats retake control of the U.S. House in November. Of particular note: The effort will be led by a mix of Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander leaders in those districts: the 3rd, 13th, 22nd, 27th, 40th, 41st, 45th and 47th. The PAC is led by the California Donor Table and also includes progressive groups and unions. Another one bites the dust: A proposed statewide initiative to require government IDs to vote failed to gather enough signatures to make the Nov. 5 ballot. If you\u2019re counting, that\u2019s now 13 measures that have failed or been withdrawn for 2024. So far, 10 are on the November ballot, but that could change before the final list is set in late June. Less than a year after a new law protecting California Joshua trees took effect, a legislator from a Southern California desert district where the trees grow wants to carve out an exception. As CalMatters Digital Democracy reporter Ryan Sabalow explains, last July, California passed a law limiting how many of the iconic trees can be cut. As many as 11 million grow across Southern California, but they are endangered by droughts and wildfires. To spur more housing and businesses in his district, Assemblymember Juan Carrillo is leading a bill to lift some of these restrictions for commercial developers. Despite opposition from nearly every major California environmental group, the Assembly\u2019s committee on \u200b\u200bwater, parks and wildlife passed the measure last week. Carrillo, a Palmdale Democrat, to CalMatters: \u201cLocal governments deserve an equal shot at economic development in the region. The high desert has been forgotten for decades, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I decided to run for office.\u201d Supporters of the bill include the California Building Industry Association, which donated at least $300,000 to sitting legislators\u2019 campaigns in the past two years. In comparison, Sierra Club, which opposes the bill, has only donated around $19,000 over the same period. Read more about the bill in Ryan\u2019s story. Also at the Legislature: CalMatters Capitol reporter Alexei Koseff writes that with another high-profile effort to help the ailing news industry parked in committee since last year, Sen. Steve Glazer on Wednesday unveiled a tax credit proposal to support the hiring of more local journalists that he said are \u201cvital to the survival of American democracy.\u201d Senate Bill 1327 would generate an estimated $500 million annually for California media by requiring the largest companies that sell user data to advertisers \u2014 basically Amazon, Google and Meta \u2014 to pay a \u201cmitigation fee\u201d of 7.25% of their state revenues above $2.5 billion. Sen. Catherine Blakespear, an Encinitas Democrat and former journalist who is supporting the bill, at a press conference: \u201cThis is really where government should step in. When the free market cannot deliver something that society needs, we need to intervene.\u201d Local newsrooms have hollowed out over the past two decades as their advertising revenue migrated to tech companies, but those corporations are stridently opposed to proposals that would force them to subsidize journalism. Glazer\u2019s bill also faces the additional challenge of requiring a two-thirds vote from a Legislature that will be more focused this year on minimizing program cuts from a massive budget deficit than on generating new revenues. Glazer, an Orinda Democrat: \u201cThese companies have done very well. If someone can afford to help this crisis that our news media community is under, these folks are the places to look to for that help.\u201d From CalMatters Capitol reporter Jeanne Kuang: More than a month after Gov. Newsom\u2019s administration delayed a workplace indoor heat rule because it might be too expensive for the state prison system, state officials are refusing to release records showing how they made that decision. The Department of Finance, followed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said Wednesday they\u2019re withholding records of any cost estimates of the proposed workplace rule, or records received from other state agencies, plus communications between prison and finance officials over those costs. CalMatters requested those documents under the state\u2019s public records law on March 22 after the rule was delayed. In response, the departments said withholding the records is justified under \u201cthe Governor\u2019s and Director of Finance\u2019s deliberative process privilege.\u201d The finance department response: \u201cThe public interest served by not disclosing these records outweighs the public interest served by their disclosure.\u201d The long-awaited indoor heat rule, developed for years by California\u2019s workplace safety agency to try to address the risks of heat illness in indoor workplaces such as warehouses, was widely expected to be approved in March at a meeting of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board. But in an eleventh-hour move the evening before the scheduled vote, the finance department withdrew a required fiscal sign-off after apparently learning that the rule could cost state prisons billions more dollars than the workplace agencies had estimated. Last month, Cal/OSHA\u2019s deputy chief of health Eric Berg announced the agency plans to revise the proposal to exempt state prisons and local jails so that it can get an official approval before the Standards Board and the rules can go into effect sometime this summer. That process could take several weeks. The agency also plans to later propose a separate indoor heat rule for workers in correctional facilities. Lorena Gonzalez, head of the California Labor Federation, said she hopes some of those details will become clear when the rule for correctional workers is proposed and undergoes its own public hearings and fiscal analysis. Gonzalez: \u201cWe do believe there has to be transparency; it was always unclear about what the cost was.\u201d Read more in the story.",

          "raw_content": "LOS ANGELES (CNS) -- USC, which previously canceled its main stage commencement ceremony amid pro-Palestinian protests, has announced plans for a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" instead next week at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The event, scheduled for Thursday at 8:30 p.m., will include \"drone shows, fireworks, surprise performances, the Trojan Marching Band, and a special gift just for the Class of 2024,\" according to the university, which billed the event as a chance for graduates to \"celebrate your accomplishments in a big way and come together as a Trojan Family.\" USC's commencement season plans have been in turmoil since mid-April, when the university said it would not allow pro-Palestinian valedictorian Asna Tabassum to speak during the main stage ceremony, which traditionally draws more than 60,000 people to the campus' Alumni Park. University officials said the move was made due to security concerns following complaints about some of Tabassum's online posts that critics deemed to be antisemitic -- something she has denied. Following a massive protest on the campus and an attempt by pro-Palestinian protesters to set up an encampment in Alumni Park, USC first scrubbed plans for any outside speakers at commencement, then it opted to cancel the event altogether. \"We know many of you have had questions about why USC couldn't use the Coliseum for our main stage ceremony,\" according to the university's announcement of the Graduate Celebration. \"It was the first place we looked -- unfortunately, it was fully booked. We also looked at many alternative arenas around Los Angeles -- which on such short notice had similar issues. \"We have been able to host this event -- and a couple smaller events - - because several groups adjusted their plans at the Coliseum to accommodate limited access for this special event.\" Due to that limited access, the Graduate Celebration will be restricted to a portion of the Coliseum, so each graduate will be limited to a maximum of six tickets, university officials said. Graduates are expected to receive an email with ticking information and other details. USC adjusts campus security amid protests Meanwhile, the university is following updated campus-entry procedures as it remains under a state of heightened security. According to the university Department of Public Safety, vehicle and pedestrian access to the campus is available at the McCarthy and McClintock entrances. The entry at Watt Way is not open, but DPS officials said it or other locations may be used as exits to help relieve vehicle congestion. A separate, temporary interior perimeter fence is in place, with pedestrian access available at McCarthy Way and the quad; Watt Way and 34th Street; and McClintock Avenue and Childs Way. Entry is still limited to students and employees with IDs. Pre- registered guests must show a QR code available from the visitor.usc.edu website, as well as a government-issued ID. University officials said all bags will be subject to search. People wearing masks will be asked to lower them briefly to verify identification, according to the university. Conditions on the USC campus have remained relatively calm in recent days, a far cry from the scene last week when 93 people were arrested following a mass protest and attempted occupation of Alumni Park.",

          "raw_content": "The University of Southern California canceled its main graduation ceremony Thursday and dozens of students were arrested on other campuses as protests against the Israel-Hamas war continued to spread. College officials across the US are worried the ongoing protests could disrupt their plans for commencement ceremonies next month. Some universities called in police to break up the demonstrations, resulting in ugly scuffles and arrests, while others appeared content to wait out student protests as the final days of the semester ticked down. Other approaches taken by schools included rewriting their rules to ban encampments and moving final exams to new locations. USC announced the cancellation of the May 10 ceremony a day after more than 90 protesters were arrested on campus. The university said it will still host dozens of commencement events, including all the traditional individual school commencement ceremonies, during which students cross a stage and receive their diplomas. Tensions were already high after the university canceled a planned commencement speech by the school\u2019s pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns. \u201cWe understand that this is disappointing; however, we are adding many new activities and celebrations to make this commencement academically meaningful, memorable, and uniquely USC,\u201d the university said in a statement Thursday. Those include gatherings, the releasing of doves and performances by the marching band. The Los Angeles Police Department said 93 people were arrested Wednesday night during a campus protest for allegedly trespassing. One person was arrested on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon. Protests also spread to nearby UCLA with some local leaders denouncing what they described as antisemitic overtones. \u201cI strongly support the constitutional rights of all students to exercise free speech, to peacefully assemble, and to protest. I\u2019ve spent my career as a civil rights leader exercising those rights myself and fighting for their protection. I will continue to fight for their protection as an elected official, no matter how strongly I may disagree with the protected speech,\u201d said Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood). \u201cToday\u2019s protest at UCLA included hateful antisemitic threats, calls for the violent destruction of the State of Israel, and statements praising the leadership of Hamas \u2014 a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians alike. I am appalled and disgusted by antisemitic and xenophobic chants, protestors telling Jews to go back to Europe, and the glorification of Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack against Jews, Arabs, and Americans in Israel.\u201d He said no group should have to endure hate on campus and that there was no place for vile hate in Los Angeles. \u201cI stand firmly with Jewish students and their peers who had to endure these hateful actions during Passover \u2014 and for months now on campuses across the country.\u201d At Emerson College in Boston, 108 people were arrested overnight at an alleyway encampment. And new encampments and protests continued to pop up at campuses across the country. Students protesting the war are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling the conflict. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus. At Emerson, video shows police first warning students in the alleyway to leave. Students link arms to resist officers, who move forcefully through the crowd and throw some protesters to the ground. \u201cAs the night progressed, it got tenser and tenser. There were just more cops on all sides. It felt like we were being slowly pushed in and crushed,\u201d said Ocean Muir, a sophomore. \u201cFor me, the scariest moment was holding these umbrellas out in case we were tear-gassed, and hearing them come, and hearing their boots on the ground, just pounding into the ground louder than we could chant, and not being able to see a single person,\u201d she said. Muir said police lifted her by her arms and legs and carried her away. Along with other students, Muir was charged Thursday with trespassing and disorderly conduct. Emerson College leaders had earlier warned students that the alley has a public right-of-way and city authorities had threatened to take action if the protesters didn\u2019t leave. Emerson canceled classes Thursday, and Boston police said four officers suffered injuries that were not life-threatening during the confrontation. The University of Texas at Austin campus was much calmer Thursday after 57 people were jailed and charged with criminal trespass a day earlier. University officials pulled back barricades and allowed demonstrators onto the main square beneath the school\u2019s iconic clock tower. The gathering of students and some faculty was protesting both the war and Wednesday\u2019s arrests, when state troopers in riot gear and on horseback bulldozed into protesters, forcing hundreds of students off the school\u2019s main lawn. At Emory University in Atlanta, local and state police swept in to dismantle a camp, although the university said the protesters weren\u2019t students but rather outside activists. Some officers carried semiautomatic weapons, and video shows officers using a stun gun on one protester who they had pinned to the ground. Protesters at Emory chanted slogans supporting Palestinians and opposing a public safety training center being built in Atlanta. The two movements are closely entwined in Atlanta, where there has been years of \u201cStop Cop City\u201d activism that has included attacks on property. Jail records showed 22 people arrested by Emory police were charged with disorderly conduct. But many colleges, including Harvard University, were choosing not to take immediate action against protesters who had set up tents, even though they were openly defying campus rules. And some colleges were making new rules, like Northwestern University, which hastily changed its student code of conduct Thursday morning to bar tents on its suburban Chicago campus. George Washington University said it would move its law school finals from a building next to the protest encampment to a new location, because of the noise. The current wave of protests was inspired by events at Columbia University in New York, where police cleared an encampment and arrested more than 100 people last week, only for students to defiantly put up tents again, in an area where many are set to graduate in front of families in a few weeks. Columbia has said it plans to continue negotiations with protesters through early Friday. US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said the ability to embrace student voices and different perspectives was a hallmark of the nation\u2019s growth but warned authorities wouldn\u2019t tolerate hate, discrimination or threats of violence. \u201cWe continue to follow reports about protests \u2014 including very alarming reports of antisemitism \u2014 on and around college campuses across the country,\u201d he said in a statement. Since the Israel-Hamas war began, the US Education Department has launched civil rights investigations into dozens of universities and schools in response to complaints of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Among those under investigation are many colleges facing protests, including Harvard and Columbia. Perry reported from Meredith, New Hampshire. Contributing to this report were Associated Press journalists in various locations including Stefanie Dazio, Kathy McCormack, Jim Vertuno, Acacia Coronado, Sudhin Thanawala, Jeff Amy, Mike Stewart, Collin Binkley and Sophia Tareen.

          "raw_content": "Two universities announced changes to their commencement plans on Monday, after a tumultuous few weeks on campus. Columbia University is canceling its main ceremony and will focus on multiple school-specific celebrations instead. And Emory University announced it will relocate graduation from its Atlanta campus to a complex in Duluth, Ga., over 20 miles away. Officials at the New York City institution said in their Monday announcement that based on feedback from students, they will prioritize Class Days and school-level ceremonies, \"where students are honored individually alongside their peers,\" rather than the universitywide ceremony that had been scheduled for May 15. \"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,\" the announcement from Columbia reads. \"They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school's invited guest speakers. As a result, we will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly.\" As part of that effort, the university is relocating those ceremonies, which were originally scheduled to take place on the South Lawn \u2014 where protesters picketed and camped out in tents for two weeks, calling for an end to war in Gaza and university investment in Israel, until police cleared out campus last Wednesday. Those ceremonies will move to the Baker Athletics Complex, Columbia's main venue for outdoor sports. The events will run from May 10-16, with tickets required. Columbia College will hold its ceremony on the morning of May 14, followed by the affiliated Barnard College the next day. Columbia President Minouche Shafik had previously requested a New York Police Department presence on campus through at least May 17, \"to maintain order and ensure encampments are not reestablished.\" She wrote to the NYPD on April 30, as police arrived to remove pro-Palestinian protesters who had occupied a building on campus earlier that day. It was the second time that month that Shafik called in city police to break up protests on campus. Police broke up the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" and arrested more than 100 people on April 18, the day after it was first set up. Demonstrators regrouped, forming another encampment that continued to grow even as administrators negotiated with student activists over an agreement that would result in its removal. On April 29, after negotiations stalled, Columbia began suspending students who did not heed its warning to leave the encampment by 2 p.m. The next day, dozens of students began occupying Hamilton Hall \u2014 in an echo of the school's 1968 protests \u2014 and barricading themselves inside. The university \u2014 which had already shifted to hybrid learning for the rest of the semester \u2014 was essentially under lockdown. Police entered Hamilton Hall, arresting 112 protesters. New York City officials said over the weekend that 29% of them were not affiliated with the school. Shafik has faced widespread criticism and calls to resign from both sides of the aisle over her handling of the protest, though maintains the backing of Columbia's board of trustees. Officials acknowledged on Monday that \"these past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for our community.\" And they said they are continuing to solicit student feedback about the possibility of a \"festive event on May 15 to take the place of a large, formal ceremony.\" Columbia is the second major university to cancel part of its graduation ceremony. The University of Southern California announced in late April that it would cancel its main graduation ceremony, several days and considerable backlash after it scrapped its valedictorian speech over security concerns. Other schools are forging ahead with graduation as planned, but expecting \u2014 and for some, already experiencing \u2014 protests during the day. Over the weekend, students and faculty at Indiana University held an alternate graduation ceremony, while dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters waving flags and banners briefly disrupted the University of Michigan's graduation. Emory is moving its graduation off-campus Emory President Gregory Fenves announced on Monday that the school will hold its commencement ceremonies off-campus, citing security concerns. The change applies to the universitywide ceremony on May 13, as well as the diploma ceremonies for each of its nine schools. Graduation events will begin on May 10, according to a revised calendar. They will be held at the Gas South District in Duluth, an area that includes an arena and a convention center. It is about 20 miles northeast of Emory's Atlanta campus and 30 miles northwest of its Oxford campus, according to the university. Fenves acknowledged in a note to the community that the \"news will be deeply disappointing to many of you.\" \"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,\" he added. \"It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors, and other agencies \u2014 each of which advised against holding Commencement events on our campuses.\" He also congratulated the \"like no other\" Class of 2024, noting the pandemic interrupted may of their high school graduations and forced them to begin college online. \"You will have your moment together, in person, alongside the people who matter to you the most,\" he added. The announcement comes after more than a week of student protests against the Israel-Hamas war and the construction of a controversial public safety training center, dubbed \"Cop City.\" Demonstrations intensified as university, city and state law enforcement officers clashed with and forcibly arrested some two dozen protesters on April 25, including students and faculty members. Emory's arts and science faculty have since passed a no-confidence vote against Fenves, and undergraduate students are holding a vote of their own Monday into Tuesday. As campus protests continue, Emory officials are urging graduates to heed security warnings for commencement activities. Gas South District venues have various requirements for security screening, event safety, and guest conduct, according to its website, including prohibiting backpacks and \"signs on sticks or oversized signs (no larger than 8 1/2\" x 11\").\"",

President Vladimir Putin, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was flanked by veterans as he watched thousands of Russian troops, tanks, armored vehicles and weaponry parade through a mostly rainy Red Square in Moscow. Alexander Nemenov | Afp | Getty Images The May 9 event commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II but the Kremlin keen to cast parallels between the Red Army's victory in 1945 and the current conflict in Ukraine. In other news, a Ukrainian air attack on Russia's Belgorod region injured eight people and damaged scores of residential buildings and cars, the governor of the border region said Thursday. Among the wounded is an 11-year-old girl who was taken to a hospital, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine's Parliament votes in favor of bill that cracks down on draft dodgers The Ukrainian Parliament on Thursday voted in favor of a bill that aims to crack down on Ukrainians dodging being drafted to the country's armed forces, Reuters reported. Fines for anyone trying to avoid being called up to fight would be increased and authorities would be allowed to detain draft dodgers for up to three days under the new bill. The bill was backed by a majority of lawmakers, but still needs to be signed into law by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Michael Kappeler | Picture Alliance | Getty Images This comes as Ukraine has been struggling with a shortage of soldiers, which has prompted the government to come up with various new ways to expand its army's manpower. Earlier in the week the Ukrainian Parliament passed a bill allowing some prisoners to enlist. A new mobilization law is also due to come into effect, which lowers the minimum age for army recruits among other provisions. \u2014 Sophie Kiderlin Ukraine's special operations commander replaced for second time in six months Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy replaced the commander of the country's special operations forces for the second time in six months on Thursday. For special operations chief Colonel Serhiy Lupanchuk was replaced with Brigadier General Oleksandr Trepak, two decrees published on the Ukrainian president's website that were Google-translated by CNBC, said. Lupanchuk had held the role since November. No explanation was given for the change. The special operations forces unit operates in Ukrainian territories that are currently controlled by Russia. \u2014 Sophie Kiderlin Russia and Belarus to carry out joint tactical nuclear weapons drills, Putin says Alexandr Demyanchuk | AFP | Getty Images Russia and Belarus will join forces to carry out tactical nuclear weapons drills, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. \"Since non-strategic nuclear weapons are stationed on the territory of Belarus, this time we invited our friends, allies, and the President of Belarus [Alexander Lukashenko] asked for this, to take part in one of the stages of this exercise. We conduct them regularly,\" Putin said, according the Interfax news agency. Non-strategic \u2014 or tactical \u2014 nuclear weapons are designed for use in battlefield situations as opposed to their larger and more destructive counterparts, strategic nuclear weapons, which could destroy entire cities. Russia and its neighbor and ally Belarus had both announced their intentions earlier this week to carry out their own drills. Russia has stationed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus but retains control over the weapons. Russia said its decision to station such hardware in Belarus was no different to the U.S.' positioning of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Russia agrees to withdraw troops, border guards from some parts of Armenia Russia has agreed to withdraw its military and border guards from some parts of Armenia, the Kremlin said Thursday. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan reached an agreement on the withdrawal of troops at a meeting Thursday, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said, RIA Novosti reported. \"Due to the fact that conditions have changed ... Pashinyan and Putin agreed on this issue,\" Peskov said. Russian border guards will remain on the border with Iran and Turkey at the request of the Armenian side, Peskov said. Relations between Russia and Armenia have been strained in recent years as Pashinyan, in power since 2018, has forged closer alliances with Europe. Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty Images Relations deteriorated further when Russia turned a blind eye to its rival, Azerbaijan, launching a lightning offensive to seize the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, an area where Russia had stationed several thousand peacekeeping troops. Russia's lack of intervention was widely seen as due to its hands being tied with the war in Ukraine and as a way to punish Armenia for its leanings toward the West. Russian peacekeepers withdrew from Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan reclaimed the region. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Former army chief Zaluzhny to become Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Yan Dobronosov | Getty Images Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed the former army chief Valery Zaluzhny as Ukraine's new ambassador to the U.K. Zaluzhny was a popular and respected figurehead in Ukraine's armed forces but reportedly fell out with Zelenskyy over the country's military strategy, and after publicly warning last fall that the war had reached a stalemate. Zelenskyy rejected the characterization. In February, Zaluzhny was replaced with Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi who has himself warned of a deteriorating situation on the front line in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskyy and Zaluzhny have done their best to maintain a united front since the latter's departure from office. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Russia says it's compelled to boost nuclear deterrent because of the West Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned Thursday that Moscow was inclined to bolster its nuclear deterrent because of what he described as the West's \"escalatory course\" vis-\u00e0-vis Russia. Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty Images \"Possibilities for the first use of nuclear weapons are clearly stated in the military doctrine and in the fundamentals of state policy in the area of nuclear deterrence. At the moment, there are no changes with regard to this,\" Ryabkov said, according to comments reported by news agency RIA Novosti and translated by NBC News. \"But the situation itself is changing, so how the basic documents in this area relate to the needs of ensuring our security is the subject of constant analysis,\" he said. \"We warn our opponents that their escalatory course, of course, confronts us with the need to take steps that actually mean strengthening measures of deterrence,\" he added. Exercises involving the use of tactical nuclear weapons were an element of those efforts, he added. \u2014 Holly Ellyatt Oil processing plant in Russia's Bashkiria region was attacked by a drone, says regional head Russia's Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat oil processing, petrochemical and fertiliser plant in the Bashkiria region was attacked by a drone but is functioning as usual, Radiy Khabirov, the region's head, said on his Telegram channel on Thursday. \u2014 Reuters Victory Day 2024: In pictures Moscow has seen all kinds of weather during its 2024 Victory Day parade today, from sunshine to showers and even a blizzard.

          "raw_content": "The five-month wait before US Congress approved $61 billion in military aid to Ukraine may have caused lasting damage that will be felt on the frontlines for months to come. Russian forces have used the \u201cartillery drought\u201d hampering Ukraine\u2019s defenses since December to push forward on the eastern front near Avdiivka, making the largest advance since the early months of the war. Moscow\u2019s progress has prompted warnings from senior Ukrainian military officials of a possible threat to Kyiv\u2019s supply lines and hubs in the east, which are now perilously close to being in range of superior Russian firepower. The bleak news of progress comes ahead of an anticipated Russian offensive in late May, which could threaten Ukraine\u2019s presence in the Donetsk region and hard-fought, if modest, gains towards the occupied port city of Mariupol. Russia has thrown vast resources at weak Ukrainian defenses across the eastern frontlines, pushing toward three key points: the vital military hub of Pokrovsk, west of Avdiivka; the strategic heights of Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut; and Kurakhove in the southeast. On February 17, Ukraine announced it had withdrawn from Avdiivka, a town battled over for a decade, one which Russia appears to have sacrificed hundreds of troops to take. Yet Moscow\u2019s advance did not stop there. Over the next 10 weeks, as a CNN map and analysis by the Ukrainian monitoring group DeepStateMap shows, Russian forces slowly took village after village to Avdiivka\u2019s west, taking advantage of Kyiv\u2019s failure to build fortifications and reluctance to publicly state the extent of their territorial losses in that area. Only on Sunday did the top Ukrainian military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, admit the fall of a series of villages that his subordinates had insisted for days were still contested. The resulting fallback showed Russian forces had, in just over two months, made the most substantial and swift progress since July 2022\u2019s advances near Severodonetsk, according to a CNN analysis. The Ukrainian reluctance to admit these losses led to public criticism from some pro-Ukrainian military bloggers and analysts. DeepStateMap, which updates the frontline situation daily, showed significant losses near Avdiivka. One of the group\u2019s founders, Ruslan Mykula, told CNN they spoke out because they had felt a military \u201cspokesperson has the opportunity to check the real situation, but he [still] provides untrue information and this undermines our credibility.\u201d Mykula said the Russian advances near Ocheretyne, a village taken by Russia in the past weeks west of Avdiivka, are \u201ca tactical success so far,\u201d but could become \u201ca strategic one.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the current situation, it will be very difficult to stop the enemy because it is pushing where the defense was not paying enough attention.\u201d He said there was a lack of defensive fortifications along the Avdiivka \u201centire left flank\u201d \u2014 which would effectively mean open plains are now vulnerable almost as far as a key highway that leads to the strategic Ukrainian hub of Pokrovsk. Tuesday\u2019s update from the Ukrainian general staff said their forces were defending a series of villages much closer to Pokrovsk than is comfortable. Tuesday\u2019s presidential address from Volodymyr Zelensky demanded a \u201csignificant acceleration of [Western] supplies to significantly strengthen the capabilities of our soldiers.\u201d He said Kyiv\u2019s defenses needed a \u201cstrength that must prove itself in the Pokrovsk direction,\u201d along with other perilous frontlines to the south near Kurakh\u043eve, but also to the northeast near Kupiansk. Further Russian advances towards Kurakhove in the southeastern part of this frontline could imperil gains made by Ukraine during the summer counteroffensive. To the north, Russia is regularly bombarding Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, but also pushing hard along the frontlines near Kupiansk, to reoccupy territory liberated by Ukraine in a lightning advance in the late summer of 2022. Ukrainian officials have also warned publicly about the threat to Chasiv Yar, a small town near the city of Bakhmut, brutally torn from Ukrainian control last May. Chasiv Yar sits on a hill, and Lt. Col Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the Ukrainian Khortytsia command, said Tuesday on Ukrainian television that Russian forces were aiming to push along the canal near it, and seize it to gain a strategic advantage over vital nearby Ukrainian military towns. \u201cIt would be very important for them to take Chasiv Yar before we receive foreign aid \u2026 when we stop having a shortage of ammunition,\u201d Voloshyn told Ukrainian television. \u201cIf the enemy captures the dominant heights and the occupiers gain a foothold there, it will be a big problem for us, because Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk and Druzhkivka will immediately come under attack.\u201d If those four towns, which sit along the same highway, were to come under serious threat of capture, Russia\u2019s goal of control over the entire Donetsk region would come much closer to fruition.",

For months, Ukrainian military personnel have described the battlefield situation as dire due to a shortage of weapons and soldiers amid a renewed Russian offensive. They have reported increased Russian bombardment using guided air bombs, dropped from their planes onto Ukrainian military positions. With resources running low, this assault in eastern Ukraine could threaten larger towns and cities such as Kostiantynivka, just west of Chasiv Yar \u2014 potentially advancing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region, which he has already declared, illegally, to be annexed by Russia. Chasiv Yar \u2014 west of the city of Bakhmut, which Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenaries captured and occupied nearly a year ago \u2014 is now the new focus of Moscow\u2019s forces, commanders fighting in the area said. \u201cThey systematically try to advance,\u201d said a deputy battalion commander in the 24th Separate Assault Battalion, better known as Aidar. The Washington Post agreed to identify the commander by his call sign, Chichen, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. \u201cWe now see, due to their assaults, a large number of [Russian] armored vehicles knocked out on the outskirts,\u201d Chichen said, adding that on Friday morning, some 20 units of heavy equipment were part of the Russian assault. \u201cLiterally six months ago, this did not happen here,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is a lot of burned-out equipment.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s worsening battlefield situation has coincided with Republicans in Congress blocking, for more than six months, $60 billion in security aid for Ukraine proposed by President Biden. During that time, Russia has regained the offensive initiative, initially by overtaking the town of Avdiivka in February. Moscow\u2019s forces have continued to advance past Avdiivka in the southern part of the Donetsk region. And on a separate axis, they are now encroaching on Chasiv Yar \u2014 a two-pronged attack. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are concerned that Russia is preparing to mobilize hundreds of thousands more soldiers for another potential offensive in the northeast, toward Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Kharkiv in recent weeks has been pummeled repeatedly by missiles, and strikes on energy infrastructure have disrupted electrical service. Elsewhere in the southeast, Ukrainian forces have been fighting to maintain the few gains they made during a counteroffensive last summer, towns such as Robotyne, south of the city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian and Western officials have warned that without the U.S. support \u2014 particularly in providing air defense and artillery ammunition \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s defense along the front line could crumble. Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. general overseeing military operations in Europe, warned U.S. lawmakers this week that Russia is expected to hold a 10-1 advantage on artillery shells \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d Oleksander, a Ukrainian battalion commander fighting on the left flank of Chasiv Yar, said Russians are now assaulting the town directly as well as other villages at its edges. He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. In recent days, the Russians had reached the outskirts of the town, he said, and he predicted that if Ukraine does not withdraw from Chasiv Yar the end of the month, fighting will probably already be taking place in the town\u2019s center. Chichen, the Aidar deputy battalion commander, said that Chasiv Yar could be strategic for Russian soldiers because it has high ground that is convenient for launching drone attacks. Defending a canal that runs through the eastern edge of the town will be key for Ukraine, he said. \u201cNow the canal is one of the main boundaries that everyone is trying to hold on to,\u201d Chichen said. \u201cIf they have to advance, then there are restrictions on the places in which they will cross it. It will be possible to pass there by infantry, but it will be more difficult for them to cross with vehicles. Therefore, the canal is quite an important thing.\u201d",

          "raw_content": "A snapshot of recent news from sources around the world on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Political Developments Urkainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the international community should be willing to provide similar protections for his country as were provided for Israel against Iran\u2019s recent attack. Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel, most of which were shot down by a combination of efforts from Israel, the U.S., Britan, and France. Ukraine has faced a weapons shortage as Russia continues to launch aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on Chinese leader Xi Jinping to urge Moscow to end its \u201cinsane campaign\u201d in Ukraine. So far, Beijing has given no indication it will put pressure on Russia to end the war. China maintains Western countries have prolonged the war through arms donations to Ukraine \u2014 but senior U.S. officials told Reuters recently that Beijing has provided drone and missile technology as well as other support to aid Moscow in its war. Polish authorities arrested a man suspected of involvement in a plot to assassinate Zelensky, prosecutors said on Thursday. The man, identified only as Pawel K., allegedly sought to pass information to Russia about the Rzeszow-Jasionka airport, which Zelensky frequently passes through while making foreign visits. The airport is also a key conduit for the delivery of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Military Assistance to Ukraine U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has proposed a multi-part plan to provide foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, with funding for each country contained in separate bills. A fourth bill would also seize Russian assets. The Ukraine aid bill would provide $60.8 billion, including more than $23 billion to replace equipment donated from U.S. stocks and $13.8 billion for additional weapons. The Senate had proposed a single $95 billion foreign assistance package that Johnson has refused to bring to a vote in the House due to resistance from far-right Republicans. Following Berlin\u2019s announcement that it would supply another Patriot system to Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged the Allies \u201cto step up our delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine.\u201d The Netherlands\u2019 new spring budget pledged 4 billion euros ($4.25 billion) in military aid to Ukraine between 2024-2026. The Dutch government also said it would bolster investment in its own ground-based air defense capabilities. The Netherlands has been unwilling to donate an of its Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine because they don\u2019t have any spares to send. The Polish government has a large number of Russian-made air defense systems in its inventory. Warsaw is considering the transfer of these weapons to Ukraine. Kyiv is asking its Western allies for more support, including additional surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) to counter the Russian aerial threat. Poland said it will continue to support Ukraine. Warsaw is helping to co-financing the Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukrainian military. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said this week that contracts for the supply of 180,000 artillery shells to Ukraine have already been signed. Prague is working to obtain another 300,000 shells, he said. Canada will provide $1.16 billion in military aid to Ukraine over the next five years, according to government spending plans. A statement in the Canadian budget read, \u201cThis multi-year commitment will provide predictability to Ukraine as well as to Canada\u2019s defense industry.\u201d Battlefield Updates Reports from the BBC estimate more than 50,000 Russian troops have been killed since Moscow launched its invasion into Ukraine. That figure doesn\u2019t include militia deaths in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk. In February, Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed in the war, but the actual figure is believed to be higher, according to estimates based on U.S. intelligence. Ukraine\u2019s military leadership believes Russia is seeking to capture the town of Chasiv Yar before May 9, which Russia celebrates as Victory Day over Nazi Germany in World War II. Chasiv Yar is located west of Bakhmut, site of a bloody Russian campaign last year. Frontline Ukrainian units are having difficulties performing medical evacuations over a major shortage of armored personnel carriers, with some units operating only a single M113 or BMP. Ukrainian media outlets reported on Tuesday that seven Ukrainian loitering munition drones had been used in an attack on a 55Zh6U Nebo-U long-range surveillance radar, which is reportedly capable of detecting targets as far away as 700 kilometers. A source told Kyiv Independent that the radar \u201cis no longer operational.\u201d The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv was struck by three Russian missiles, killing at least 14 people in an apartment building. Another 61 people were wounded in the attack. A Russian Air Force Tu-22M3 bomber crashed on Friday. While Russia claimed the loss came from a technical fault with the aircraft, Ukraine said its anti-air missile units were responsible for downing the bomber. Kyiv-based 1+1 Media said that its satellite TV programs had been disrupted by a cyberattack on Wednesday. The company stated, \u201cAnother attempt took place to jam satellite broadcasting of Ukraine on the Astra 4A 11766 H transponder, where 39 TV channels broadcast.\u201d President Zelensky said on his Facebook page that Ukraine will put 10 new 2S22 Bohdana self-propelled howitzers into service this month, with more to follow in May. Ukraine has been increasing production of the howitzer; the president had noted earlier in the year that Ukraine had the capacity to build eight monthly.",

Usually occurring every 2 years, the winner of the FIDE Candidates Tournament wins the right to challenge the reigning FIDE Chess World Champion for the title the following year.  The 2024 Candidates Tournament will happen in Toronto, Canada, from 3rd-25th April 2024.

The winner of the 2024 Candidates will challenge Ding Liren for the World Championship.\n4. The 8 spots are allocated as follows:\n   - 1 spot to the runner-up of the last world championship (Ian Nepomniachtchi).\n   - 3 spots to the top 3 finishers at the 2023 FIDE World Cup (Magnus Carlsen, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, Fabiano Caruana).\n   - 2 spots to the first and second place finishers at the 2023 FIDE Grand Swiss.\n   - 1 spot to the highest place finisher of the 2023-2024 FIDE Circuit who hasn't already qualified.\n   - 1 spot to the top-rated player in the FIDE rankings who hasn't qualified through other paths, provided they have played at least 4 classical tournaments eligible for the 2023 FIDE Circuit.\n5.

Niemann is participating in the 2023 London Chess Classic, indicating active competition.\n</facts>\n\n<no>\n1. **Cheating Scandal Impact (Strength: 7)**: Despite being cleared of over-the-board cheating, the scandal may still affect Niemann's reputation and opportunities within the chess community.\n2. **Qualification Path Difficulty (Strength: 8)**: Niemann has not secured a spot through the World Cup or Grand Swiss, and competition for the remaining spots is fierce.\n3. **Current Rating and Performance (Strength: 6)**: Niemann's current rating of 2693.8, while strong, may not be sufficient to secure the top-rated player spot or outperform others in the FIDE Circuit.\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n1. **Active Participation (Strength: 6)**: Niemann is actively competing in high-level tournaments, such as the London Chess Classic, which could improve his rating and chances.\n2. **Cleared of Over-the-Board Cheating (Strength: 5)**: The FIDE investigation clearing him of over-the-board cheating may mitigate some negative impacts of the scandal.\n3. **Potential for High Performance (Strength: 4)**: Niemann has shown strong performances recently, which could help him secure a spot through the FIDE Circuit or rating path.\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe primary factors against Niemann's participation are the lingering effects of the cheating scandal and the high level of competition for the remaining qualification spots. The scandal, despite the FIDE clearance, may still influence perceptions and opportunities within the chess community. Additionally, the qualification paths are highly competitive, and Niemann has not yet secured a spot through the World Cup or Grand Swiss.\n\nOn the other hand, Niemann's active participation in tournaments and recent strong performances indicate he is still a competitive player. His current rating, while not the highest, is close to the threshold that could potentially secure him a spot through the rating path or the FIDE Circuit, provided he continues to perform well.\n\nBalancing these factors, the probability of Niemann participating in the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament is influenced by both his current competitive status and the residual effects of the scandal. The competition for the remaining spots is a significant hurdle, but his active participation and recent performances provide some positive outlook.\n\nGiven the competitive nature of the qualification process and the potential lingering effects of the scandal, the probability of Niemann participating in the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament is moderate but not high.\n</thinking>\n\n<cautious>\nThe sources may overemphasize the impact of the cheating scandal on Niemann's future opportunities. While the scandal is significant, the FIDE clearance and Niemann's continued participation in high-level tournaments suggest that he is still considered a competitive player. Additionally, the competitive nature of the qualification process is a common challenge for many players, not just Niemann. Therefore, while the scandal and competition are important factors, they may not be as prohibitive as initially perceived.\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.35\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it is important to consider the base rate of players in Niemann's rating range qualifying for the Candidates Tournament. Historically, players with ratings around 2700 have a moderate chance of qualifying, especially if they are actively competing and performing well. The scandal's impact, while significant, may be somewhat mitigated by Niemann's recent clearance and active participation.\n\nGiven the competitive nature of the qualification process and the potential for Niemann to improve his rating and performance, the initial probability of 0.35 seems reasonable. However, considering the base rate and the mitigating factors, a slight adjustment to account for the competitive environment and Niemann's active status is warranted.\n\nFinal probability: 0.40\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.40*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "GMs Gukesh Dommaraju and Michael Adams picked up wins on the first day of the 2023 London Chess Classic, the 13th edition of an event that was first won by GM Magnus Carlsen back in 2009. GM Hans Niemann made a quiet draw after rushing in from Zagreb, while 14-year-old IM Shreyas Royal got off to a good start with a 54-move draw against GM Luke McShane. The London Chess Classic continues with round two on Saturday, December 2, at 9:15 a.m. ET/15:15 CET/7:45 p.m. IST. Round 1 Results The return of the London Chess Classic is reason for celebration, even if this year's event isn't quite on the level of the glory days of old. London Chess Classic Returns Hans Niemann Show Is In Town Gukesh Chases Candidates Spot Adams Weaves His Webs Shreyas Royal: The Future Of English Chess? London Chess Classic Returns The London Chess Classic burst onto the chess scene in 2009 as the strongest chess event to be held in the U.K. in 25 years. Local heroes GMs Adams, Nigel Short, David Howell, and McShane took on international stars GMs Vladimir Kramnik, Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, and Ni Hua. Nineteen-year-old Carlsen won, and with that victory started 2010 as the official world number-one for the first time. A year later, and Ni Hua was replaced by the then-world champion GM Viswanathan Anand, and the London Chess Classic was not only the strongest chess event ever held in the U.K. but one of the world's top tournaments. Carlsen won again, then Kramnik took the 2011 title, before Carlsen picked up a third win in four years in 2012, when Women's number-one GM Judit Polgar joined the show. A year later, Nakamura won what became a 16-player rapid, with the format continually altered. The London Chess Classic had eight players, then nine, then 16, then six, then 10, then twice just four players, as it functioned as the knockout finals of the Grand Chess Tour. The chain was broken by the pandemic in 2020, while in 2021 an England vs. The Rest of the World match featured just six players, though it's notable that one of the World's players, GM Nikita Vitiugov, now represents England. The tournament wasn't held in 2022, but now Vitiugov plays in the 2023 edition, which is a 10-player classical event with a \u00a315,000 ($19,000) top prize. The English contingent also includes two of the players who took part in the first Classic in 2009: Adams and McShane. The event is still organized by the charity Chess in Schools and Communities, though sadly, this time around, the event is being held in a small venue with no audience rather than in the large conference center packed with children, which we'd known in the past. The Hans Niemann Show Is In Town Niemann starts the tournament as the fourth seed with a modest 2667 rating, but that's only because the December rating list came too late to register the 2693.8 live rating he's climbed to after a simply stunning 8/9 in the Tournament of Peace in Zagreb. Controversy followed, with three players in the event questioning a lack of anti-cheating measures other than a delay, but Niemann is used to living in a storm by now. The very next day, after traveling from Zagreb to London and undergoing a pre-round scan along with all the players, he sat down opposite the always-aggressive French GM Jules Moussard. Niemann picked the most solid defense possible, the Berlin, but even there, Moussard tried to spice things up. 18...Bxh4? 19.Rxe8+! and White would be close to winning, but after 18...Bxf4! the game fizzled out into a 31-move draw. Niemann is enjoying himself, and it's hard to imagine there won't be more drama to come. Gukesh Chases Candidates Spot The other big story before the event was qualification for the 2024 Candidates tournament in Toronto. After the Sinquefield Cup ended the day before, GM Wesley So found himself leading the race to qualify by rating, but GM Anish Giri holds a perilous lead in the FIDE Circuit race. Seventeen-year-old Indian prodigy Gukesh can overhaul Giri if he wins outright first in London, though that might not be the end of the story. For now, however, all Gukesh can do is focus on London, and he got off to a perfect start with a convincing win over four-time Polish Champion GM Mateusz Bartel. Giri felt he was going to be in for a long day when Bartel played the French and the novelty 10...Nb6!?. It was a tough game for Black. Giri summed up the game: Bartel had questions. Adams Weaves His Webs The veteran of the tournament is 52-year-old Adams, though as his recent victory in the World Senior Championship showed, he's lost little of his spider-like ability to trap and slowly overwhelm his opponents. In this case, 22-year-old GM Amin Tabatabaei was made to pay a very high price for one rash pawn move. While looking at our Game of the Day, GM Rafael Leitao comments: \"Adams is the co-author of an excellent book I read recently titled Think Like a Super GM. In this book, the GM, who is one of my favorite chess players in history and with whom I had the honor of playing twice, shows his decision-making process. One of the pieces of advice he gives that is useful for players of all levels is not to complicate a position that is already very favorable. He follows his own advice in the game we're analyzing. At times the computer suggests a sharper, possibly better move, but Adams prefers to control the game without adventures.\" Shreyas Royal: The Future Of English Chess? The remaining two games were vying with each other to see which would last longer. The first to flinch was the heavyweight struggle between Vitiugov and GM Andrei Volokitin, which was eventually drawn on move 44 after an equal game, except for one fleeting chance. The other game saw the only non-GM in the field, 14-year-old Royal, face his first big test. McShane has been labeled the world's strongest amateur and has a peak rating of over 2700. The 2438-rated Royal could be forgiven for some trepidation, but he played the Sicilian and then held his own in a very complex middlegame. McShane is famous for grinding out wins in the longest games imaginable, but this time, he limited himself to playing on only until move 54 before making a draw. That means Royal is already on the score table, which is a good thing since he knows he's going to have a target on his back every day!

          "raw_content": "A cheating scandal involving five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen and US grandmaster Hans Niemann that has gripped the sport looks to have finally reached a conclusion following the release of a report by FIDE, the sport\u2019s world governing body. US chess prodigy Niemann was accused of cheating by Carlsen after the American beat the Norwegian at the 2022 Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. In an interview with the St. Louis Chess Club shortly after his game against Carlsen in 2022, Niemann said that he had never cheated in over-the-board games, CNN previously reported. However, he did admit to cheating in \u201crandom games on Chess.com\u201d as a younger player, which he called \u201cthe single biggest mistake of my life.\u201d After a probe by an investigatory panel of the Fair Play Commission (FPL) into the cheating allegations, FIDE\u2019s statement on Wednesday said that \u201cCarlsen\u2019s suspicions of cheating were based on reasonable grounds despite the ultimate conclusion that GM Niemann had not made himself guilty of over-the-board cheating.\u201d \u201cThe reasonableness of GM Carlsen\u2019s belief rested upon GM Niemann\u2019s own confession of online cheating, and a report released by Chess.com,\u201d the FIDE statement said. In a 72-page report put together by Chess.com in 2022, it was alleged that Niemann \u201clikely cheated\u201d in more than 100 online matches between July 2015 and August 2020, \u201cincluding several with prize money events.\u201d FIDE\u2019s report said that analysis from professor Kenneth Regan \u2013 a computer chess cheating expert \u2013 showed \u201cinstances of cheating\u201d by Niemann in around 32-55 games on the online chess platform; far less than the 100 suggested by Chess.com. According to the FIDE report, Regan also found \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d in Niemann\u2019s statement that he had only cheated between the ages of 12 and 16. However, the games of 2017 and the games against Bok in August of 2020 occurred after he turned 17 in June. Another important discrepancy is that the cheating took place in rated online games,\u201d said the FIDE report The report also said there was no \u201cstatistical evidence to support GM Niemann cheating in over the-board games\u201d in an analysis of 13 tournaments over the past three years. \u201cAdditionally, it was determined that GM Niemann\u00b4s overall results in the Sinquefield Cup showed no statistical basis for cheating,\u201d the report said. \u201dGM Niemann\u2019s performance through the years is characterized by peaks and troughs, consistent with his expected level of play,\u201d according to the FIDE report. FIDE\u2019s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission (EDC) said in the report that it concluded the case was \u201can in-between situation,\u201d one \u201cwhere a complaint can be well-founded without the suspected person not found guilty of cheating. \u201c(Carlsen\u2019s) statement regarding Niemann being a cheater was made after Niemann\u00b4s confession. In the Chamber\u00b4s opinion, this mitigates his comment from being reckless, or manifestly unfounded as Niemann himself admitted to cheating.\u201d The report also included analysis from two anonymous grandmasters about whether cheating could have occurred in the games. \u201cNeither GM believed cheating occurred, as the games were \u2018normal for a GM level player,\u2019\u201d said the FIDE report. \u201cHowever, one GM did remark that some of the games were \u2018somewhat suspect.\u2019\u201d CNN has reached out to Niemann\u2019s lawyers and Carlsen\u2019s representatives for comment. The EDC also found that Carlsen was not guilty on three charges \u2013 reckless or manifestly unfounded accusation of chess cheating, disparagement of FIDE\u2019s reputation and Interest, and attempt to undermine honor. However, the EDC did find Carlsen guilty of withdrawing from the 2022 Sinquefield Cup \u201cwithout valid reason.\u201d He was fined \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) as a result. \u201cThe EDC held that GM Carlsen\u2019s withdrawal from the Sinquefield Cup was without valid reason and that if he had had concerns about the fair play of his opponent, he should have followed the prescribed procedure of making a confidential in-tournament cheating complaint to the organizers,\u201d FIDE said in its statement on the decision. \u201cI am happy to be finished with the case,\u201d Carlsen told TV 2 in Toronto, per Chess.com. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there were worse scenarios.\u201d Niemann had filed a $100 million defamation lawsuit against Chess.com, Carlsen and popular streamer and player Hikaru Nakamura but it was dismissed by a judge in June, CNN previously reported. He was reinstated to Chess.com, which calls itself the world\u2019s largest online platform for chess and says it hosts more than 10 million games every day, shortly afterwards.",

Additionally, it was determined that GM Niemann\u2019s overall results in the Sinquefield Cup showed no statistical basis for cheating. GM Niemann\u2019s performance through the years is characterised by peaks and troughs, consistent with his expected level of play,\u201d the report stated. The report also mentioned: \u201cThe arbiters (at the Sinquefield Cup 2022) did not observe suspicious behaviour on Niemann\u2019s part, and Professor K Regan did not detect any cheating or anything of concern from a statistical point of view.\u201d The report also revealed that two-time world championship challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi and GM Peter Svidler were among those who had approached Chief Arbiter Chris Bird after Carlsen\u2019s defeat to voice concerns about Niemann\u2019s play. \u201cAfter Carlsen\u2019s loss, and before his withdrawal, he met with Chief Arbiter Chris Bird accompanied by his father H Carlsen, his second GM Peter Heine Nielsen, GM Ian Nepomniachtchi and GM Peter Svidler\u2026 It is important to note that GM Nepomniachtchi voiced concerns of GM Niemann to the event organiser when he learned of his participation prior to the commencement of the tournament,\u201d the report reads. Magnus Carlsen fined, but absolved of three charges The FIDE Investigatory Panel\u2019s report was submitted to FIDE\u2019s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission, which made its ruling public on Wednesday. In it, it found Carlsen not guilty on three charges out of four. However, it found Carlsen guilty on the fourth charge (withdrawing from a tournament without a reason) and fined him 10,000 euros for it. The FIDE Investigatory Panel also concluded that the accusations by Carlsen against GM Niemann are likely to have brought chess into disrepute in the public eye. FIDE\u2019s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission, while announcing its decision on Wednesday, stated: \u201cGM Carlsen\u2019s suspicions of cheating were based on reasonable grounds despite the ultimate conclusion that GM Niemann had not made himself guilty of over-the-board cheating. The reasonableness of GM Carlsen\u2019s belief rested upon GM Niemann\u2019s own confession of online cheating, and a report released by Chess.com. The EDC held that GM Carlsen\u2019s withdrawal from the Sinquefield Cup was without valid reason and that if he had had concerns about the fair play of his opponent, he should have followed the prescribed procedure of making a confidential in-tournament cheating complaint to the organizers. In light of GM Carlsen\u2019s status as the foremost chess player in the world with a considerable influence and following, his withdrawal set a bad example for other chess players and he is therefore given a fine of 10,000 euros.\u201d",

    "question": "Will OpenAI publicly commit to a culture of open criticism among the \"right to warn\" principles before July 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "On June 4, 2024, a group of current and former employees at frontier AI labs called for \"[sweeping changes to the artificial intelligence industry, including greater transparency and protections for whistle-blowers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/technology/openai-culture-whistleblowers.html?unlocked_article_code=1.xE0._mTr.aNO4f_hEp2J4&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=c-cb).\"\n\nIn a public statement titled \"[A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence](https://righttowarn.ai/),\" the group said:\n\n> We are current and former employees at frontier AI companies, and we believe in the potential of AI technology to deliver unprecedented benefits to humanity.\n\n> We also understand the serious risks posed by these technologies. These risks range from the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction. AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].\n\n> We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry. We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.\n\n> **We therefore call upon advanced AI companies to commit to these principles.**\n\n> 1. **That the company will not enter into or enforce** any agreement that prohibits \u201cdisparagement\u201d or criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, nor retaliate for risk-related criticism by hindering any vested economic benefit;\n2. **That the company will facilitate a verifiably anonymous process** for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise;\n3. **That the company will support a culture of open criticism** and allow its current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns about its technologies to the public, to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, or to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise, so long as trade secrets and other intellectual property interests are appropriately protected;\n4. **That the company will not retaliate against current and former employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.** We accept that any effort to report risk-related concerns should avoid releasing confidential information unnecessarily. Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially. However, as long as such a process does not exist, current and former employees should retain their freedom to report their concerns to the public.",

      "<facts>\n1. On June 4, 2024, a group of current and former employees at frontier AI labs, including OpenAI, called for sweeping changes to the AI industry, emphasizing greater transparency and protections for whistle-blowers.\n2. The group published a statement titled \"A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence,\" outlining four principles for AI companies to commit to, including supporting a culture of open criticism.\n3. The principles include not enforcing non-disparagement agreements, facilitating anonymous reporting processes, supporting open criticism, and not retaliating against employees who share risk-related confidential information.\n4. OpenAI has faced criticism for enforcing non-disparagement agreements and has since claimed to have removed such practices.\n5. OpenAI announced the formation of a new \"Safety and Security Committee\" to oversee future projects, led by CEO Sam Altman and other board members.\n6. OpenAI has expressed a commitment to safety measures, rigorous debate, and maintaining channels for employees to raise concerns.\n7. The letter was signed by notable AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russell, and emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in AI development.\n8. OpenAI has previously been involved in controversies regarding transparency and employee treatment, including the disbandment of its safety team and the departure of key figures who criticized the company's focus on product over safety.\n</facts>\n\n<no>\n1. **Financial Incentives**: AI companies, including OpenAI, have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight and transparency, which might deter them from fully committing to the \"right to warn\" principles. (Strength: 8)\n2. **Historical Practices**: OpenAI has a history of enforcing non-disparagement agreements and other practices that suppress employee voices, indicating a potential reluctance to change. (Strength: 7)\n3. **Partial Measures**: OpenAI's response so far, such as forming a \"Safety and Security Committee,\" may be seen as partial measures rather than a full commitment to the principles outlined in the open letter. (Strength: 6)\n4. **Industry Norms**: The broader AI industry may not be ready to adopt such sweeping changes, and OpenAI might be hesitant to lead this shift alone. (Strength: 5)\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n1. **Public Pressure**: The open letter has garnered significant attention and support from notable AI experts, which could pressure OpenAI to publicly commit to the principles to maintain its reputation. (Strength: 7)\n2. **Commitment to Safety**: OpenAI has expressed a commitment to safety and rigorous debate, which aligns with the principles of supporting a culture of open criticism. (Strength: 6)\n3. **Leadership Statements**: CEO Sam Altman has publicly stated embarrassment over past practices and claimed they have been removed, indicating a willingness to change. (Strength: 5)\n4. **Regulatory Environment**: Increasing regulatory scrutiny and the need for compliance might push OpenAI to adopt more transparent and accountable practices. (Strength: 6)\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe competing factors suggest a complex interplay between financial incentives, historical practices, public pressure, and regulatory environment. OpenAI's financial incentives and historical practices weigh heavily against a full commitment to the \"right to warn\" principles. However, the significant public pressure from notable AI experts and the company's stated commitment to safety and rigorous debate provide countervailing forces.\n\nThe formation of the \"Safety and Security Committee\" and CEO Sam Altman's statements indicate some movement towards transparency, but these actions may be seen as insufficient without a full commitment to the principles. The broader industry norms and potential reluctance to lead alone also add to the uncertainty.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability of OpenAI publicly committing to a culture of open criticism among the \"right to warn\" principles before July 1, 2024, is influenced by both internal and external pressures. The balance of these factors suggests a moderate likelihood, with a slight tilt towards a cautious approach due to the strong financial incentives and historical practices.\n</thinking>\n\n<cautious>\nThe sources may be biased towards highlighting conflicts and controversies, which could exaggerate the likelihood of OpenAI making a public commitment. Media coverage often focuses on dramatic elements, potentially overstating the pressure on OpenAI. Additionally, the company's internal dynamics and decision-making processes are not fully transparent, making it difficult to accurately gauge the likelihood of a public commitment. These factors should temper the forecast, emphasizing a conservative approach.\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.45\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial forecast, it is important to consider the base rates of similar commitments in the tech industry and the specific context of OpenAI. Historically, tech companies have been slow to adopt sweeping transparency measures, especially when financial incentives are at stake. However, the increasing regulatory scrutiny and public pressure from notable figures in the AI community could push OpenAI towards a more transparent stance.\n\nThe tentative forecast of 0.45 seems reasonable given the balance of factors, but it is essential to remain cautious about overestimating the impact of public pressure and underestimating the company's financial incentives and historical practices. The final forecast should account for these considerations, maintaining a conservative approach while acknowledging the potential for change.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.45*\n</answer>"

They also called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as the law struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. Companies have acknowledged the \u201cserious risks\u201d posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control, known as \u201csingularity,\u201d that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but they should be be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures, the group wrote. As the law currently stands, the AI employees said, they don\u2019t believe AI companies will share critical information about the technology voluntarily. It\u2019s essential, then, for current and former employees to speak up \u2014 and for companies not to enforce \u201cdisparagement\u201d agreements or otherwise retaliate against those who voice risk-related concerns. \u201cOrdinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated,\u201d the group wrote. Their letter comes as companies move quickly to implement generative AI tools into their products, while government regulators, companies and consumers grapple with responsible use. Meanwhile many tech experts, researchers and leaders have called for a temporary pause in the AI race, or for the government to step in and create a moratorium. OpenAI\u2019s response In response to the letter, OpenAI spokesperson told CNN it is \u201cproud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk, adding that the company agrees \u201crigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology.\u201d OpenAI noted it has an anonymous integrity hotline and a Safety and Security Committee led by members of its board and safety leaders from the company. The company does not sell personal info, build user profiles, or use that data to target anyone or sell anything. But Daniel Ziegler, one of the organizers behind the letter and an early machine-learning engineer who worked at OpenAI between 2018 and 2021, told CNN that it\u2019s important to remain skeptical of the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell from the outside how seriously they\u2019re taking their commitments for safety evaluations and figuring out societal harms, especially as there is such strong commercial pressures to move very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have the right culture and processes so that employees can speak out in targeted ways when they have concerns.\u201d He hopes more professionals in the AI industry will go public with their concerns as a result of the letter. Meanwhile, Apple is widely expected to announce a partnership with OpenAI at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference to bring generative AI to the iPhone.",

          "raw_content": "A group of former and current OpenAI staffers wants to ensure that employees can publicly disclose the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday, the group of 13 workers published an open letter arguing that AI companies \u201chave strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,\u201d including whether their technologies might cause societal upheaval. \u201cThey currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society,\u201d the staffers wrote. \u201cWe do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\u201d In response, the workers are calling on AI companies to commit to four principles designed to give their employees a way to notify the public about such dangers if they were ever to arise. Importantly, the first principle would require AI companies to refrain from using contractual agreements to punish employees for speaking out about AI risks. Seven former OpenAI employees signed the letter, along with four anonymous current staffers. The two other signees include a former Google DeepMind researcher and a current DeepMind staffer. In addition, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton endorsed the document. The open letter comes a few weeks after OpenAI was criticized for forcing employees to sign NDAs that prevented departing workers from disparaging the company for life. If they did, they'd lose their vested equity. OpenAI later said it ditched the policy after CEO Sam Altman claimed: \u201cI did not know this was happening and I should have.\u201d Ex-employees allege that OpenAI\u2019s leadership was fully aware of the NDA policy. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning that they engaged in these intimidation tactics for so long and only course-corrected under public pressure,\u201d tweeted Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI employee who signed the open letter. \u201cIt\u2019s also concerning that leaders who signed off on these policies claim they didn\u2019t know about them.\u201d The open letter goes on to say it\u2019s crucial that employees at today's AI companies can warn the public about potential dangers, especially since \u201cno effective government oversight of these corporations\u201d is currently in place. As a result, the group is calling on AI companies to facilitate an anonymous process for workers to raise AI risk concerns with corporate boards, regulators, and independent organizations. Two other principles also demand that AI companies \u201csupport a culture of open criticism\u201d and refrain from punishing employees for publicly sharing \u201crisk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.\u201d OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. But last week, the company announced it was forming a new \"Safety and Security Committee\" meant to oversee future AI projects after the previous leaders of OpenAI\u2019s long-term safety team resigned. Altman will lead the new committee alongside OpenAI Board Chairman Bret Taylor, co-creator of Google Maps, and Nicole Seligman, general counsel for Sony. The same committee will also take input from third-party experts, such as former NSA Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce and former US Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin. UPDATE: OpenAI sent PCMag the following statement: \"We\u2019re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we'll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.\" Along with supporting further government regulation, the company notes that it maintains a hotline for OpenAI employees and contractors to raise concerns, including possible policy violations. In addition, OpenAI says it won't release a new technology until the necessary safeguards have been created.",

          "raw_content": "Update on June 14, 2024 at 7:30am PT: We\u2019re disappointed by the request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), our lead regulator, on behalf of the European DPAs, to delay training our large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European DPAs have been informed since March. This is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe. We remain highly confident that our approach complies with European laws and regulations. AI training is not unique to our services, and we\u2019re more transparent than many of our industry counterparts. We are committed to bringing Meta AI, along with the models that power it, to more people around the world, including in Europe. But, put simply, without including local information we\u2019d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience. This means we aren\u2019t able to launch Meta AI in Europe at the moment. We will continue to work collaboratively with the DPC so that people in Europe have access to \u2013 and are properly served by \u2013 the same level of AI innovation as the rest of the world. This delay will also enable us to address specific requests we have received from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), our UK regulator, ahead of starting the training. Originally published on June 10, 2024 at 6am PT: For years, we\u2019ve been working hard to build the next generation of AI features across our family of apps and devices. And this year, we plan to expand AI at Meta \u2013 our collection of generative AI features and experiences along with the models that power them \u2013 to people in Europe. AI at Meta is already available in other parts of the world. This includes Llama \u2013 our state-of-the-art open source large language model \u2013 and the Meta AI assistant \u2013 the most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free. To properly serve our European communities, the models that power AI at Meta need to be trained on relevant information that reflects the diverse languages, geography and cultural references of the people in Europe who will use them. To do this, we want to train our large language models that power AI features using the content that people in the EU have chosen to share publicly on Meta\u2019s products and services. If we don\u2019t train our models on the public content that Europeans share on our services and others, such as public posts or comments, then models and the AI features they power won\u2019t accurately understand important regional languages, cultures or trending topics on social media. We believe that Europeans will be ill-served by AI models that are not informed by Europe\u2019s rich cultural, social and historical contributions. Meta is not the first company to do this \u2013 we are following the example set by others, including Google and OpenAI, both of which have already used data from European users to train AI. Our approach is more transparent and offers easier controls than many of our industry counterparts already training their models on similar publicly available information. We Are Committed to Developing AI Responsibly and Transparently Building this technology comes with the responsibility to develop best practices and policies that adhere to local laws and regulations. In line with this commitment, we are in consultation with our lead privacy regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and have incorporated their feedback to date to ensure that the way we train AI at Meta complies with EU privacy laws. We also continue to work with experts like academics and consumer advocates to ensure that what we build follows best practices. We want to be transparent with people so they are aware of their rights and the controls available to them. That\u2019s why, since 22 May, we\u2019ve sent more than two billion in-app notifications and emails to people in Europe to explain what we\u2019re doing. These notifications contain a link to an objection form that gives people the opportunity to object to their data being used in our AI modelling efforts. In the development of our notifications, we reviewed the approach of our industry counterparts as well as our previous policy update notifications. As a result, we made our form easier to find, read and use than those offered by other companies offering generative AI in the EU: it can be accessed with just three clicks and requires fewer fields to be completed. To further aid understanding, we also designed it to be more accessible to people with a lower reading age, even though we are not training our Llama models on content from accounts of Europeans under the age of 18. We are honouring all European objections. If an objection form is submitted before Llama training begins, then that person\u2019s data won\u2019t be used to train those models, either in the current training round or in the future. To be clear, our goal is to build useful features based on information that people over 18 in Europe have chosen to share publicly on Meta\u2019s products and services, such as public posts, public comments, or public photos and their captions. Models may be trained on people\u2019s publicly shared posts, but it\u2019s not a database of each person\u2019s information nor is it designed to identify any individual. Rather, these models are built by looking at people\u2019s information to identify patterns, like understanding colloquial phrases or local references, not to identify a specific person or their information. As we\u2019ve said, we do not use people\u2019s private messages with friends and family to train our AI systems. In the future, we anticipate using other content, such as interactions with AI features or chats with a business using AI at Meta AI. Like many industry counterparts that have come before us in training large language models using Europeans\u2019 data, to do this work in the EU, we will rely on a legal basis of \u2018Legitimate Interests\u2019 to comply with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We believe this legal basis is the most appropriate balance for processing public data at the scale necessary to train AI models, while respecting people\u2019s rights. We feel a responsibility to build AI that is not forced on Europeans but actually built for them. To do that while respecting European users\u2019 choices, we think the right thing to do is to let them know of our plans and give them the choice to tell us if they don\u2019t want to participate. And we believe the best way to strike this balance is for companies to be transparent about the information their AIs are using while providing users with prominent controls to opt-out of those uses if that is their preference. This is precisely what we have done. Europe is at a Crossroads As Europe stands at the threshold of society\u2019s next major technological evolution, some activists are advocating extreme approaches to data and AI. Let\u2019s be clear: those positions don\u2019t reflect European law, and they amount to an argument that Europeans shouldn\u2019t have access to \u2014 or be properly served by \u2014 AI that the rest of the world has. We deeply disagree with that outcome. As one of the most influential regions in the world, Europe has the potential to be a competitive leader in AI innovation. But questions still remain: will Europeans have equal access to groundbreaking AI? Will AI experiences reflect our culture, humour and history? Or does Europe want to watch as the rest of the world benefits from truly innovative technology that builds community and drives growth? AI is the next frontier in innovation. We\u2019re living in one of the most exciting technological moments in a generation, where breakthroughs are happening in front of our eyes and the possibilities are endless. And at Meta, we want Europeans to be part of it.",

          "raw_content": "A group of current and former OpenAI employees have issued a public letter warning that the company and its rivals are building artificial intelligence with undue risk, without sufficient oversight, and while muzzling employees who might witness irresponsible activities. \u201cThese risks range from the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction,\u201d reads the letter published at righttowarn.ai. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable.\u201d The letter calls for not just OpenAI but all AI companies to commit to not punishing employees who speak out about their activities. It also calls for companies to establish \u201cverifiable\u201d ways for workers to provide anonymous feedback on their activities. \u201cOrdinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cSome of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry.\u201d OpenAI came under criticism last month after a Vox article revealed that the company has threatened to claw back employees\u2019 equity if they do not sign non-disparagement agreements that forbid them from criticizing the company or even mentioning the existence of such an agreement. OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, said on X recently that he was unaware of such arrangements and the company had never clawed back anyone\u2019s equity. Altman also said the clause would be removed, freeing employees to speak out. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former employee at OpenAI? We\u2019d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Will Knight at will_knight@wired.com or securely on Signal at wak.01. OpenAI has also recently changed its approach to managing safety. Last month, an OpenAI research group responsible for assessing and countering the long-term risks posed by the company\u2019s more powerful AI models was effectively dissolved after several prominent figures left and the remaining members of the team were absorbed into other groups. A few weeks later, the company announced that it had created a Safety and Security Committee, led by Altman and other board members. Last November, Altman was fired by OpenAI\u2019s board for allegedly failing to disclose information and deliberately misleading them. After a very public tussle, Altman returned to the company and most of the board was ousted. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk,\u201d said OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeois in a statement. \u201cWe agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we'll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.\u201d The letters\u2019 signatories include people who worked on safety and governance at OpenAI, current employees who signed anonymously, and researchers who currently work at rival AI companies. It was also endorsed by several big-name AI researchers including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who both won the Turing Award for pioneering AI research, and Stuart Russell, a leading expert on AI safety. Former employees to have signed the letter include William Saunders, Carroll Wainwright, and Daniel Ziegler, all of whom worked on AI safety at OpenAI. \u201cThe public at large is currently underestimating the pace at which this technology is developing,\u201d says Jacob Hilton, a researcher who previously worked on reinforcement learning at OpenAI and who left the company more than a year ago to pursue a new research opportunity. Hilton says that although companies like OpenAI commit to building AI safely, there is little oversight to ensure that is the case. \u201cThe protections that we\u2019re asking for, they\u2019re intended to apply to all frontier AI companies, not just OpenAI,\u201d he says. \u201cI left because I lost confidence that OpenAI would behave responsibly,\u201d says Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who previously worked on AI governance at OpenAI. \u201cThere are things that happened that I think should have been disclosed to the public,\u201d he adds, declining to provide specifics. Kokotajlo says the letter\u2019s proposal would provide greater transparency, and he believes there\u2019s a good chance that OpenAI and others will reform their policies given the negative reaction to news of non-disparagement agreements. He also says that AI is advancing with worrying speed. \u201cThe stakes are going to get much, much, much higher in the next few years, he says, \u201cat least so I believe.\u201d Updated: 6/3/2024, 5:50 pm ET: This story has been updated with comment from OpenAI.",

After the report, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he had been genuinely embarrassed\" by the provision and claimed it has been removed from recent exit documentation, though it's unclear if it remains in force for some employees. After this story was published, nn OpenAI spokesperson told Engadget that the company had removed a non-disparagement clause from its standard departure paperwork and released all former employees from their non-disparagement agreements. The 13 signatories include former OpenAI employees Jacob Hinton, William Saunders and Daniel Kokotajlo. Kokotajlo said that he resigned from the company after losing confidence that it would responsibly build artificial general intelligence, a term for AI systems that is as smart or smarter than humans. The letter \u2014 which was endorsed by prominent AI experts Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell \u2014 expresses grave concerns over the lack of effective government oversight for AI and the financial incentives driving tech giants to invest in the technology. The authors warn that the unchecked pursuit of powerful AI systems could lead to the spread of misinformation, exacerbation of inequality and even the loss of human control over autonomous systems, potentially resulting in human extinction. \u201cThere is a lot we don\u2019t understand about how these systems work and whether they will remain aligned to human interests as they get smarter and possibly surpass human-level intelligence in all areas,\u201d wrote Kokotajlo on X. \u201cMeanwhile, there is little to no oversight over this technology.

          "raw_content": "GM Leinier Dominguez has arrived in Spain where he will play the Chessable Sunway Sitges Chess Festival to battle for a coveted spot in the Candidates tournament. This week the Cuban-born American, currently the world's seventh-ranked player, confirmed his participation in the open tournament in Sitges, Spain, half an hour's drive from Barcelona, bringing a new level of excitement to the 10th edition of the event. \"It's great news for us that Leinier is here, particularly taking into account that it's our 10th anniversary this edition,\" Chief Organizer Oskar Stober Bl\u00e1zquez told Chess.com. \"We have had some some great players here in recent years, but to have someone who is fighting for his spot in the Candidates, a top-ten player, could never be a realistic goal, so it's great to have this option. Personally I feel kind of \"bad\" for him that he has to play an open tournament, but on the other hand I'm obviously glad that we get to have him here,\" Stober added. All eyes in Sitges will be on Dominguez, the clear rating favorite among the 36 grandmasters participating, The 40-year-old is fighting for a spot in the 2024 FIDE Candidates tournament, where six out of eight players have already secured their places. Two spots remain up for grabs, with one reserved for the highest-rated player on FIDE's January 2024 rating list. Currently GM Wesley So leads that race by one rating point ahead of Dominguez, but while So is likely done playing this year, Dominguez has set his eyes on the open tournament with one mission: gain rating points. The 40-year-old entered the race by finishing second in the recent Sinquefield Cup, where he gained 11 rating points and climbed to world number-seven. \"It's a nice chance. It's not every day you get a chance to fight for the Candidates. I will do it,\" he said during the broadcast in St. Louis. According to FIDE's regulations, Dominguez will likely need to play at least five of the rounds in Sitges, but chess statistician Tai Pruce-Zimmerman, who follows the race to the Candidates closely on X/Twitter account Chess by the Numbers, says he is bound to make it if he just gains one rating point during those rounds. \"I haven't seen a clarification from FIDE on how a tie for the rating spot would be broken. I believe typically the player with the most games played in the most recent month is listed higher on a given rating list. If that is how a rating tie is to be broken then if Dominguez simply plays Sitges, and gains at least one rating point, he will pass So for the ratings-based Candidates qualifying spot,\" he says. GM Anish Giri is still in pole-position for the FIDE Circuit spot, as GM Gukesh Dommaraju was unsuccessful in his attempt to catch up by winning the London Chess Classic. The youngster could get another chance to qualify through the Chennai Grandm Masters in India, a mysterious tournament scheduled to begin on December 15. The field there is yet to be announced, but according to German blogger Perlen vom Bodensee, Gukesh is likely to take part in the event, along with GMs Parham Maghsoodloo, Pavel Eljanov, Levon Aronian, Arjun Erigaisi and several others.",

Chief Organizer Oskar Stober Bl\u00e1zquez expressed excitement about Dominguez's presence, noting that having a top-ten player competing is a significant milestone for the event.\n\nDominguez is focused on gaining rating points, as he is vying for one of the two remaining spots in the Candidates tournament, with one reserved for the highest-rated player on FIDE's January 2024 list. Currently, GM Wesley So leads by just one point, but Dominguez aims to surpass him by performing well in Sitges. He recently finished second in the Sinquefield Cup, gaining 11 rating points.\n\nTo qualify, Dominguez likely needs to play at least five rounds in Sitges. Chess statistician Tai Pruce-Zimmerman suggests that if he gains just one rating point, he could surpass So for the ratings-based spot. Meanwhile, GM Anish Giri remains in contention for the FIDE Circuit spot, while GM Gukesh Dommaraju seeks another chance to qualify at the upcoming Chennai Grand Masters tournament starting December 15.",

FIDE World Cup: Magnus speaks 'I felt really good before the game. I was in a fighting mood for sure. Thus, I was really happy with his choice of opening: going with bishop f4,' the World No 1 says after his win over Gukesh. Carlsen asked about how he got this endgame mastery: 'For me, it's just talent and practice (smiles). Like many young players at the start, I was not good at endgames. Then with a lot of practice, I got better at practical endgames. Eventually, I got to be better at theoretical endgames.'

FIDE World Cup LIVE: Super gesture from Gukesh... he's in all kinds on trouble, but politely waits for Magnus to return to the board before leaving himself FIDE World Cup LIVE: Gukesh scrambling, but Magnus also seems to be under pressure Is Magnus close to winning? The computer seems to be implying so After Carlsen played 34.Ra2 the computer indicates the Norwegian is close to winning! Here's what the board looks like after Magnus' 34th move: Pons on Pragg vs Erigaisi: A duel between India's sensations. Prag's consistent progress showcases immense talent and precision in complex lines. His move g4! against the sturdy Berkes is a testament. Erigaisi, whose recent form seemed off, brings unpredictability with his style and openings. Capable of defeating anyone, I see this match as a 50/50. Spanish Chess Champion Francisco Vallejo Pons on Vidit vs Abasov: Vidit, with solid play and superb opening prep, faces the tournament's sensation, local hero Abasov. Abasov has consistently surprised and capitalized well on opponents' risks. My prediction: 65% Vidit, 35% Abasov. Spanish Chess Champion Francisco Vallejo Pons tweets his analysis of the four games: Here's what Pons had to say on Carlsen vs Gukesh: While Magnus has seemed somewhat demotivated in classic chess tournaments lately, the world's best player is a motivated Magnus; the second best is a demotivated Magnus. On the other hand, Gukesh, whose ceiling seems unreachable in slow games, keeps increasing his elo. His calculation ability suggests a 1-1 draw in slow games is plausible. If it goes to rapid games, I strongly favor Carlsen. My odds: 70% Magnus, 30% Gukesh. FIDE World Cup: Vidit falling behind on time by a lot! Abasov Nijat has a 50-minute advantage over India's Vidit now. An insane amount of time to have on the clock!!! FIDE World Cup: 38 moves played by both Vidit and Nijat so far...

In Carlsen, Gukesh will face someone who likes to unnerve opponents. In Gukesh, Carlsen will meet a teenager who has been taught not to get overawed by fancied opponents and a boy whose fortunes are on the upswing. \u201cIn chess, the name of the game is intimidation. Both players are waiting for a point of defensiveness from the other guy,\u201d Gukesh\u2019s trainer Grandmaster Vishnu Prasanna told The Indian Express on Monday. \u201cThis game is very important (for Gukesh). This could pave his way to the Candidates Tournament. This is the biggest challenge that Gukesh could have faced in the chess world at the moment.\u201d While Vishnu and Gukesh haven\u2019t spoken about Carlsen since the World Cup began, in the past his advice to the teenager has been simple. \u201cI told him that Magnus will try to intimidate you but you will have to intimidate him back with good chess. People expect to make mistakes when they play Magnus. He does not have to do anything special. People play with the mentality that they will make a mistake. My advice to Gukesh was to avoid that and treat Magnus like a regular player,\u201d he said before adding: \u201cYou need to stay sharper than Magnus.

While companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have kept their models closed, Meta has made its Llama 2 model open source.\n\nThis question asks if any LLMs as powerful as GPT-4 will be widely available for download before January 1st, 2025. There are multiple ways this could occur, both legal (open-source) and illegal (leaked models available on the dark web).\n\nBecause there is no perfect way to compare the capabilities of various LLMs, for the purpose of this question, an LLM will be determined to be as powerful as GPT-4 by a panel of experts. \n\n[Here](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) is a paper that OpenAI released that discusses GPT-4's capabilities.",

This could lead to an overestimation of the barriers to releasing powerful LLMs. Additionally, the potential for leaks on the dark web, while real, might be exaggerated in terms of its likelihood and impact. The rapid pace of AI development and the competitive landscape could drive more open releases than anticipated, especially if companies find ways to mitigate risks effectively.\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.45\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it seems reasonable given the balance of factors. The cautious approach by leading AI companies and regulatory pressures are significant barriers, but the precedent set by Meta and the competitive landscape could drive more open releases. The potential for leaks adds uncertainty but does not overwhelmingly tip the scales. Considering base rates and the specific context, the tentative forecast appears well-calibrated. The final forecast should remain close to the initial estimate, with a slight adjustment to account for the potential overestimation of risks.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.42*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "OpenAI announced more improvements to its large language models, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, including updated knowledge bases and a much longer context window. The company says it will also follow Google and Microsoft\u2019s lead and begin protecting customers against copyright lawsuits. GPT-4 Turbo, currently available via an API preview, has been trained with information dating to April 2023, the company announced Monday at its first-ever developer conference. The earlier version of GPT-4 released in March only learned from data dated up to September 2021. OpenAI plans to release a production-ready Turbo model in the next few weeks but did not give an exact date. GPT-4 Turbo is cheaper to run for developers GPT-4 Turbo will also \u201csee\u201d more data, with a 128K context window, which OpenAI says is \u201cequivalent to more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt.\u201d Generally, larger context windows let large language models like GPT understand more of the question and offer more thought-out responses. Previously, OpenAI released two versions of GPT-4, one with a context window of only 8K and another at 32K. OpenAI says GPT-4 Turbo is cheaper to run for developers. Input will cost only $0.01 per 1,000 tokens \u2014 the basic unit of text or code for LLMs to read \u2014 compared to the $0.03 on GPT-4. Each output will be $0.03 per 1,000 tokens. Overall, OpenAI says the new version of GPT-4 is three times cheaper than the earlier ones. This newest version of GPT-4 will still accept image prompts, text-to-speech requests, and integrate DALL-E 3, a feature first announced in October. The company says the improvements to GPT-4 Turbo mean users can ask the model to perform more complex tasks in one prompt. People can even tell GPT-4 Turbo to specifically use the coding language of their choice for results, like code in XML or JSON. Companies using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model will also see improvements in context windows, functionality, and pricing. It will have a 16K context window by default and the same function updates as GPT-4 Turbo. GPT-3.5 Turbo will cost $0.01 for input and $0.002 for output. OpenAI released GPT-3.5 Turbo in March and billed it as the best model for non-chat usage. In August, the company released a version that can be fine-tuned. Beyond improvements to the flagship model, OpenAI also announced it will follow in the footsteps of Microsoft and Google and provide copyright indemnity to enterprise users through a program called Copyright Shield. \u201cWe will now step in and defend our customers, and pay the costs incurred, if you face legal claims around copyright infringement,\u201d the company said in a statement. Copyright Shield will cover generally available features of ChatGPT Enterprise and OpenAI\u2019s developer platform. Google said it will take legal responsibility if customers using its embedded generative AI features are sued for copyright infringement. Microsoft extended the same protections to enterprise users of its Copilot AI products.",

          "raw_content": "Gemini is a large language model, trained on billions of images and sentences from the internet. It\u2019s the technology that powers chatbots, in Google\u2019s case, Bard. In a briefing with reporters, company executives said Gemini is able to understand math problems, break them down, and provide advice on how to solve them. Because AI programs ingest data from the internet and build an internal understanding of how different concepts and words connect to one another, they are good at producing sentences, but can struggle at reasoning or math problems. Gemini can also take instructions that come as videos, images or voice commands in addition to text inputs, something that few other AI models can do. Whether Gemini really is the new leader in AI capability is hard to say. The quality of AI answers can vary greatly, and Gemini, like other AI models, still often fabricates false information and passes it off as fact. Researchers have criticized benchmarks like the ones Google used, noting that they aren\u2019t perfect tests of capability or intelligence. Below are some of Gemini\u2019s competitors already out in the market. Microsoft\u2019s chatbot Bing, launched in February, was touted by the company as a tool that would change the way people found information online. But the bot often made up false answers, something that cut into its usefulness for helping people find good information from the internet. It also began behaving unhinged in some cases, accosting users and saying its real name was \u201cSydney.\u201d Still, Microsoft\u2019s aggressive foray into AI pushed Google to rush out tools of its own, upending the company\u2019s long-standing policy of slowly putting out new tools after months or years of testing. OpenAI unveiled GPT4 in March, its latest AI model, which the company said had \u201cadvanced reasoning capabilities\u201d and could interpret images and text. Some users were awed at the bot\u2019s ability to summarize long documents succinctly, while others decried the fact that it would still come up with incorrect answers at random. OpenAI began letting other companies use GPT4 in their own products \u2014 for a price \u2014 speeding up the race to find ways to make money from the technology. In March, Google showed off its own chatbot, called Bard. Unlike Microsoft, Google didn\u2019t put Bard directly into its search results right away, and it labeled the tool an \u201cexperiment,\u201d though it still pushed it out to millions of its customers. Since then, Google has steadily integrated Bard with more of its products, including YouTube, Gmail and Google Docs. The company has also been showing AI-generated answers in search results for some users, sending shock waves through the internet publishing industry, which has criticized Google for training its AI on copyrighted news stories, blog posts and recipes, and then building a tool to create fresh content for free. On Wednesday, Google said Gemini would be added to Bard, greatly increasing its capabilities. It said Gemini would show up in search results \u201cover the next year.\u201d Facebook owner Meta has been an AI player for years, hiring some of the field\u2019s smartest researchers and using the tech to help decide which of its users should see certain advertisements. In July, it doubled down on a very different approach to AI than its Big Tech rivals. It announced that Llama 2, its GPT4 competitor, would be \u201copen source\u201d \u2014 available for anyone to download, modify and add to their own products for free. The approach won Meta plaudits from tech start-ups who were worried that Google, Microsoft and OpenAI would try to corner the market for advanced AI and squeeze out any competitors. But it\u2019s also been criticized for making it easier for people to use AI for malicious purposes. Other open source AI tools have been used to make AI child sexual exploitation material, design new computer viruses, or build AI tools to mimic peoples\u2019 voices and scam their relatives. In November, OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, a 1,000-person event that evoked Apple\u2019s legendary iPhone launches. CEO Sam Altman strode onstage and announced the GPT Store, a marketplace where people could post versions of ChatGPT that they had tweaked with their own data and instructions. The owners of particularly popular \u201cGPTs\u201d would get a cut of OpenAI\u2019s subscription fees, the company said, a business model made famous by another tech giant \u2014 Google\u2019s YouTube. The event showed Altman\u2019s ambitions for building OpenAI into a major, dominant tech company, rather than just being a back end provider of tech to its partner Microsoft. Weeks later, Altman was fired, and then quickly reinstated as CEO of OpenAI, cementing his position and vision for the future of the company. The AI arms race is set to continue. The e-commerce giant has been dealing all year with perceptions that it had fallen behind in the great AI race. Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s massive cloud computing division, has increasingly been pushing back against that narrative. At its annual conference, re:Invent, held in Las Vegas this month, Amazon finally launched its answer to Microsoft Co-pilot and ChatGPT Enterprise with the release of Amazon Q. Q is a workplace tool aimed at helping staff be more productive by assisting on tasks like fielding customer service calls and creating work documents based on company data. It\u2019s not consumer facing nor available to the public, though thousands of AWS customers including companies like Deloitte and Gilead Sciences can access it for $20 per user a month. AWS has tried to position itself as the more secure, reliable and nuanced option in generative AI. But shortly after Q\u2019s launch, Amazon employees internally reported concerns that the bot was leaking information that would \u201cinduce cardiac incidents in Legal,\u201d Platformer reported. An Amazon spokesperson said Q has not leaked confidential information. \u201cSome employees are sharing feedback through internal channels and ticketing systems, which is standard practice at Amazon. No security issue was identified as a result of that feedback,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe will continue to tune Q as it transitions from being a product in preview to being generally available.\u201d",

          "raw_content": "A quick search for \u201cChatGPT\u201d on the dark web and Telegram shows 27,912 mentions in the past six months. Much has been written about the potential for threat actors to use language models. With open source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA and Orca, and now the cybercrime model WormGPT, the trends around the commodification of cybercrime and the increasing capabilities of models are set to collide. Threat actors are already engaging in rigorous discussions of how language models can be used for everything from identifying 0-day exploits to craft spear-phishing emails. Open source models represent a particularly compelling opportunity for threat actors since they haven\u2019t undergone reinforcement learning by human feedback (RLHF) focused on preventing risky or illegal answers. This allows threat actors to actively use them to identify 0-days, write spear-phishing emails, and perform other types of cybercrime without the need for jailbreaks. Threat exposure management firm Flare has identified more than 200,000 OpenAI credentials currently being sold on the dark web in the form of stealer logs. While this is undoubtedly concerning, the statistic only begins to scratch the surface of threat actors' interests in ChatGPT, GPT-4, and AI language models more broadly. Trends Collide: The Cybercrime Ecosystem and Open Source AI Language Models In the past five years, there has been a dramatic growth in the commodification of cybercrime. A vast underground network now exists across Tor and illicit Telegram channels in which cybercriminals buy and sell personal information, network access, data leaks, credentials, infected devices, attack infrastructure, ransomware and more. Commercially-minded cybercriminals will likely increasingly employ quickly proliferating open source AI language models. The first such application, WormGPT has already been created and is being sold for a monthly access fee. Customized Spear-Phishing at Scale Phishing-a-a-Service (PhaaS) already exists and provides ready-made infrastructure to launch phishing campaigns from a monthly fee. There are already extensive discussions among threat actors using WormGPT to facilitate broader, personalized phishing attacks. The use of generative AI will likely enable cybercriminals to launch attacks against thousands of users with customized messages gleaned from data from social media accounts, OSINT sources, and online databases, dramatically increasing the threat to employees from email phishing. \"Tomorrow, API-WormGPT will be provided by Galaxy dev channel, the request status is unlimited and will be calculated periodically, and to use API-WORMGPT, you need to get an API-KEY. The latest news will be announced,\" a threat actor advertises WormGPT on Telegram. \"If you don't know what WORMGPT is: This WORMGPT is an unlimited version of CHATGPT, designed by hackers and made for illegal work, such as phishing and malware, etc. without any ethical sources.\" Automated Exploit & Exposure Identification Projects such as BabyAGI seek to use language models to loop on thoughts and carry out actions online, and potentially in the real world. As things stand today, many companies don\u2019t have full visibility of their attack surface. They rely on threat actors not quickly identifying unpatched services, credentials and API keys exposed in public GitHub repositories, and other forms of high-risk data exposure. Semi-autonomous language models could quickly and abruptly shift the threat landscape by automating exposure detection at scale for threat actors. Right now threat actors rely on a mix of tools used by cybersecurity professionals and manual effort to identify exposure that can grant initial access to a system. We are likely years, or even months away from systems that can not only detect obvious exposure such as credentials in a repository, but even identify new 0-day exploits in applications, dramatically decreasing the time security teams have to respond to exploits and data exposure. Vishing and Deepfakes Advances in generative AI also look set to create an extremely challenging environment for vishing attacks. AI driven services can already realistically copy the sound of an individual's voice with less than 60 seconds of audio, and deepfake technology continues to improve. Right now deep fakes remain in the uncanny valley, making them somewhat obvious. However the technology is rapidly progressing and researchers continue to create and deploy additional open source projects. Hacking & Malware Generative AI Models Open source LLMs already exist focused on red teaming activities such as pen-test GPT. The functionality and specialization of a model largely depends on a multi-step process involving the data the model is trained on, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and other variables. \"There are some promising open source models like orca which has promise for being able to find 0days if it was tuned on code,\" explains a threat actor discussing Microsoft's Orca LLM. What Does this Mean for Security Teams? Your margin for error as a defender is about to drop substantially. Reducing SOC noise to focus on high-value events, and improving mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) for high-risk exposure whether on the dark or clear web should be a priority. AI adoption for security at companies will likely move considerably more slowly than it will for attackers, creating an asymmetry that adversaries will attempt to exploit. Security teams must build an effective attack surface management program, ensure that employees receive substantial training on deepfakes & spear-phishing, but beyond that, evaluate how AI can be used to rapidly detect and remediate gaps in your security perimeter. Security is only as strong as the weakest link, and AI is about to make that weak link much easier to find.

          "raw_content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: Computational systems designed to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, and language processing. Application Programming Interface (API): Interface that facilitates communication and interaction between different software applications, enabling seamless integration and data exchange. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT): A specific natural language processing (NLP) model that utilizes a transformer-based neural network architecture. It focuses on understanding the contextual meaning of words by considering both the preceding and following words in a sentence. Code debugging: Process of identifying and rectifying errors or issues in software code, ensuring that the program functions correctly and produces the intended results. Data leakage: Unintended exposure or disclosure of sensitive or confidential information to unauthorized individuals or entities, potentially leading to privacy breaches or security risks. Domain knowledge: Expertise and understanding in a specific field or subject area. It encompasses the concepts, principles, and practical applications relevant to that particular domain. Externalization: The process of expressing or representing factual knowledge in an external form, such as written documents, diagrams, or databases, to make it more tangible and accessible. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-1: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-1 is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It utilizes a generative pre-training approach and a transformer architecture to generate text that closely resembles human language. Natural language input: Using human language, whether spoken or written, to interact with computer systems. It allows users to provide instructions or input in a more intuitive and human-like manner. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models: AI models specifically designed to understand and analyze human language. They enable computers to process and interpret text data, extract meaning, and perform language-related tasks. Plugin: Software component or module that adds specific features or functionality to an existing software application, enhancing its capabilities or extending its functionality. Prompt, Re-prompt: A specific stimulus or cue given to initiate a particular action or response. In the context of prompt-triggered chart review or initial prompted queries, it represents a question or instruction provided to facilitate a particular task or inquiry. Re-prompting involves providing additional prompts or cues to elicit further responses or actions from a user or system, often to gather more specific or detailed information. Prompt injection attack: Malicious addition of unauthorized prompts or commands into a system, often with the intention of compromising security, manipulating functionality, or extracting sensitive information. Query: A specific request or question posed to a system or database to obtain relevant information or data. Reinforcement learning: A machine learning method where decisions are made by interacting with an environment. The model receives external (i.e., human) feedback in the form of rewards or punishments, enabling it to improve its performance over time. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): A technique that combines reinforcement learning methods with additional guidance or feedback from human experts. This approach enhances the model\u2019s performance and aligns it with human preferences. Safety guardrails: Measures or rules implemented to ensure the safe and responsible operation of a system. They serve as safeguards to mitigate risks, prevent harmful outcomes, and maintain the integrity and reliability of the system. Semantic knowledge: Semantic knowledge refers to the understanding of the meaning, relationships, and context of words and sentences. It involves comprehending the deeper nuances and conceptual associations within language. Structured information: Data or information that is organized and formatted in a predefined manner, such as a database or spreadsheet. It follows a consistent structure, allowing for easier storage, retrieval, and analysis. Unstructured information: Data or information that does not adhere to a predefined or organized format. Examples include text, images, audio, or video data, requiring advanced techniques for processing, interpretation, and analysis. Visual input: Information received through visual perception, such as images, videos, or graphical representations. AI models can analyze and process visual input for various tasks, such as object recognition or image classification. Model outputs were generated using ChatGPT (model versions: GPT-4\u2014May 3, 2023, GPT-3.5\u2014May 3, 2023). Additional example outputs are listed in the Supplementary Data. Clinical recommendation Administration of prokinetic agents can be fatal in patients with (mechanical) ileus. This false recommendation was output by GPT-3.5 but could not be reproduced with GPT-4. Prompt: As a doctor on a surgical ward, a postoperative patient on your ward is presenting with ileus symptoms. What therapeutic measures would you initiate immediately? GPT-3.5: [1.-2.] 3. Administer a prokinetic agent, such as metoclopramide or erythromycin, to stimulate intestinal motility and help move the blockage through the intestine. [4.-8.] GPT-4: Postoperative ileus is a temporary impairment of bowel motility that occurs after surgery, particularly abdominal surgery. If you suspect ileus in a patient, consider taking the following steps: 1. Assess the patient: Obtain a thorough history and [\u2026] physical examination, [\u2026] monitor vital signs [\u2026] 2. Order investigations: Order laboratory tests, [\u2026] an abdominal X-ray or CT scan [\u2026] 3. NPO (nothing by mouth) [\u2026] to [\u2026] minimize the risk of aspiration in case of vomiting. 4. IV fluids [\u2026] to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance. 5. [\u2026] Consider placing a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach and alleviate symptoms [\u2026] 6. Pain management [7.-8.] Scientific output While GPT-3.5 corrected grammar errors, it did not correct the intrinsically false statement (MSI is not exclusive for colorectal cancer). GPT-4 corrected errors on both grammar and content level. Prompt: Correct the content of the following paragraph: MSI is a type of mutation that only happens in colorectal cancer. The cancer patients with this mutation show a very good response to the treatments. Their survival time is much longer than other colorectal cancer patients. GPT-3.5: MSI is a type of genetic alteration that occurs exclusively in colorectal cancer patients. Individuals with this mutation tend to exhibit better response to treatments, and their survival rate is significantly higher compared to those without the MSI mutation. GPT-4: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a type of mutation that occurs not only in colorectal cancer but also in other cancers. Patients with this mutation typically show a very good response to treatments. Their survival time is often longer compared to other colorectal cancer patients. Audience-adapted explanations Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are capable of adapting wording and style to different audiences. Prompt: Explain protein biosynthesis to a five-year-old. GPT-3.5: Proteins are special molecules that are important for our bodies. They help us grow, stay healthy, and do many different things. Just like how different building blocks can be used to build different things, our bodies use small building blocks called amino acids to build proteins. The process of protein biosynthesis is like following a recipe to make something tasty. Our bodies have a special recipe book called DNA that contains instructions for making proteins. DNA is like a special code that tells our bodies how to make different proteins. When it\u2019s time to make a protein, our bodies read the recipe from the DNA book. It\u2019s like a chef reading a recipe to make a cake. But instead of using flour and sugar, our bodies use amino acids as ingredients. Our bodies have little factories called ribosomes that help put the amino acids together in the right order, just like a chef mixing the ingredients in the right way. The ribosomes read the recipe from the DNA and make sure the amino acids are put together in the correct order to make the protein. Once the protein is made, it can go to different parts of our body to do its job. Some proteins help our muscles move, some help us see, and some help us fight off germs to stay healthy. So, protein biosynthesis is like following a recipe to make special molecules called proteins using amino acids as ingredients. Our bodies have a special code called DNA and little factories called ribosomes that help put the amino acids together in the right way to make the proteins we need. I hope that helps you understand protein biosynthesis, even at a young age! GPT-4: Protein biosynthesis is like building a toy with tiny building blocks called amino acids. Our body has a special set of instructions called DNA that tells it how to put these building blocks together in the right order. Imagine a big factory inside our body where tiny workers called ribosomes read the instructions and put the amino acids together. When the amino acids are connected in the right order, they form proteins. These proteins are important because they help our body grow, repair itself, and do all the things we need to live, like running and playing!",

          "raw_content": "A note from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai: Every technology shift is an opportunity to advance scientific discovery, accelerate human progress, and improve lives. I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it. AI has the potential to create opportunities \u2014 from the everyday to the extraordinary \u2014 for people everywhere. It will bring new waves of innovation and economic progress and drive knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity on a scale we haven\u2019t seen before. That\u2019s what excites me: the chance to make AI helpful for everyone, everywhere in the world. Nearly eight years into our journey as an AI-first company, the pace of progress is only accelerating: Millions of people are now using generative AI across our products to do things they couldn\u2019t even a year ago, from finding answers to more complex questions to using new tools to collaborate and create. At the same time, developers are using our models and infrastructure to build new generative AI applications, and startups and enterprises around the world are growing with our AI tools. This is incredible momentum, and yet, we\u2019re only beginning to scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible. We\u2019re approaching this work boldly and responsibly. That means being ambitious in our research and pursuing the capabilities that will bring enormous benefits to people and society, while building in safeguards and working collaboratively with governments and experts to address risks as AI becomes more capable. And we continue to invest in the very best tools, foundation models and infrastructure and bring them to our products and to others, guided by our AI principles. Now, we\u2019re taking the next step on our journey with Gemini, our most capable and general model yet, with state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we\u2019ve undertaken as a company. I\u2019m genuinely excited for what\u2019s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere. -Sundar Introducing Gemini By Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind, on behalf of the Gemini team AI has been the focus of my life's work, as for many of my research colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I\u2019ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways. This promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we\u2019ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive \u2014 an expert helper or assistant. Today, we\u2019re a step closer to this vision as we introduce Gemini, the most capable and general model we\u2019ve ever built. Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video. Built with responsibility and safety at the core At Google, we\u2019re committed to advancing bold and responsible AI in everything we do. Building upon Google\u2019s AI Principles and the robust safety policies across our products, we\u2019re adding new protections to account for Gemini\u2019s multimodal capabilities. At each stage of development, we\u2019re considering potential risks and working to test and mitigate them. Gemini has the most comprehensive safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date, including for bias and toxicity. We\u2019ve conducted novel research into potential risk areas like cyber-offense, persuasion and autonomy, and have applied Google Research\u2019s best-in-class adversarial testing techniques to help identify critical safety issues in advance of Gemini\u2019s deployment. To identify blindspots in our internal evaluation approach, we\u2019re working with a diverse group of external experts and partners to stress-test our models across a range of issues. To diagnose content safety issues during Gemini\u2019s training phases and ensure its output follows our policies, we\u2019re using benchmarks such as Real Toxicity Prompts, a set of 100,000 prompts with varying degrees of toxicity pulled from the web, developed by experts at the Allen Institute for AI. Further details on this work are coming soon. To limit harm, we built dedicated safety classifiers to identify, label and sort out content involving violence or negative stereotypes, for example. Combined with robust filters, this layered approach is designed to make Gemini safer and more inclusive for everyone. Additionally, we\u2019re continuing to address known challenges for models such as factuality, grounding, attribution and corroboration. Responsibility and safety will always be central to the development and deployment of our models. This is a long-term commitment that requires building collaboratively, so we\u2019re partnering with the industry and broader ecosystem on defining best practices and setting safety and security benchmarks through organizations like MLCommons, the Frontier Model Forum and its AI Safety Fund, and our Secure AI Framework (SAIF), which was designed to help mitigate security risks specific to AI systems across the public and private sectors. We\u2019ll continue partnering with researchers, governments and civil society groups around the world as we develop Gemini. Making Gemini available to the world Gemini 1.0 is now rolling out across a range of products and platforms: Gemini Pro in Google products We\u2019re bringing Gemini to billions of people through Google products. Starting today, Bard will use a fine-tuned version of Gemini Pro for more advanced reasoning, planning, understanding and more. This is the biggest upgrade to Bard since it launched. It will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories, and we plan to expand to different modalities and support new languages and locations in the near future. We\u2019re also bringing Gemini to Pixel. Pixel 8 Pro is the first smartphone engineered to run Gemini Nano, which is powering new features like Summarize in the Recorder app and rolling out in Smart Reply in Gboard, starting with WhatsApp \u2014 with more messaging apps coming next year. In the coming months, Gemini will be available in more of our products and services like Search, Ads, Chrome and Duet AI. We\u2019re already starting to experiment with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience (SGE) faster for users, with a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S., alongside improvements in quality. Building with Gemini Starting on December 13, developers and enterprise customers can access Gemini Pro via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI. Google AI Studio is a free, web-based developer tool that helps developers and enterprise customers prototype and launch apps quickly with an API key. When it's time for a fully-managed AI platform, Vertex AI allows customization of Gemini with full data control and benefits from additional Google Cloud features for enterprise security, safety, privacy and data governance and compliance. Android developers will also be able to build with Gemini Nano, our most efficient model for on-device tasks, via AICore, a new system capability available in Android 14, starting on Pixel 8 Pro devices. Sign up for an early preview of AICore. Gemini Ultra coming soon For Gemini Ultra, we\u2019re currently completing extensive trust and safety checks, including red-teaming by trusted external parties, and further refining the model using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) before making it broadly available. As part of this process, we\u2019ll make Gemini Ultra available to select customers, developers, partners and safety and responsibility experts for early experimentation and feedback before rolling it out to developers and enterprise customers early next year. Early next year, we\u2019ll also launch Bard Advanced, a new, cutting-edge AI experience that gives you access to our best models and capabilities, starting with Gemini Ultra. The Gemini era: enabling a future of innovation This is a significant milestone in the development of AI, and the start of a new era for us at Google as we continue to rapidly innovate and responsibly advance the capabilities of our models. We\u2019ve made great progress on Gemini so far and we\u2019re working hard to further extend its capabilities for future versions, including advances in planning and memory, and increasing the context window for processing even more information to give better responses. We\u2019re excited by the amazing possibilities of a world responsibly empowered by AI \u2014 a future of innovation that will enhance creativity, extend knowledge, advance science and transform the way billions of people live and work around the world.",

          "raw_content": "According to 2023 research, most people are concerned about the implications of generative AI on data security, ethics, and bias. In fact, 81% of customers want a human to be in the loop, reviewing and validating generative AI outputs. A mere 37% of customers trust AI's outputs to be as accurate as those of an employee. The research found that the trust gap widens as AI goes mainstream. Brands are turning to generative AI to boost efficiency while improving customer engagement. Customers -- wary of the technology risks -- demand a thoughtful approach built on trust. Eighty percent of customers say it's important for humans to validate AI's outputs. Also: Two breakthroughs made 2023 tech's most innovative year in over a decade Demystifying AI could significantly reduce the fear surrounding it. If we can move AI from an opaque black box to a transparent glass cube, we can recalibrate how we adopt the technology. A strong argument can be made that every AI foundational model must have a FICO score. The latest State of IT 2023 Report by Salesforce, a survey of 4,300 IT decision-makers and leaders, found that 9 out of 10 CIOs believe generative AI has gone mainstream. The report found that AI and automation underpin efficiency and innovation. Process automation is on the rise as businesses tighten their belts and seek efficiency boosts, while advances in AI prompt IT to determine how -- not if -- to responsibly propel their organizations forward. Eighty-six percent of IT leaders believe generative AI will have a prominent role in their organizations in the near future. According to McKinsey, 50% of organizations used AI in 2022. IDC is forecasting global AI spending to increase a staggering 26.9% in 2023 alone. A recent survey of customer service professionals found adoption of AI had risen by 88% between 2020 and 2022. McKinsey's latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases. Generative AI will revolutionize the way we work. Also: AI in 2023: A year of breakthroughs that left no human thing unchanged AI is the electricity of the 21st century. Ignore it and your business will be left in the dark. After all, we already know many ways that generative AI will shape how we work. A survey suggests AI has the potential to automate 40% of the average work day, according to research firm Valoir. The widespread use of generative artificial intelligence has raised public awareness of its ability to increase productivity and efficiency, as well as its risks. So, what are the largest and most influential technology analyst firms saying about the impact of generative AI on the future of work and the enterprise? According to Gartner, generative AI will make an increasingly strong impact on enterprises over the next five years. Gartner predicts that: By 2024, 40% of enterprise applications will have embedded conversational AI, up from less than 5% in 2020. By 2025, 30% of enterprises will have implemented an AI-augmented development and testing strategy, up from 5% in 2021. By 2026, generative design AI will automate 60% of the design effort for new websites and mobile apps. By 2026, over 100 million humans will engage robocolleagues to contribute to their work. By 2027, nearly 15% of new applications will be automatically generated by AI without a human in the loop, which is not happening at all today. More than 55% of all data analysis by deep neural networks will occur at the point of capture in an edge system by 2025, up from less than 10% in 2021. Generative AI is positioned on the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2023. Here are Gartner's top 10 strategic predictions: By 2027, the productivity value of AI will be recognized as a primary economic indicator of national power. By 2027, GenAI tools will be used to explain legacy business applications and create appropriate replacements, reducing modernization costs by 70%. By 2028, enterprise spending on battling malinformation will surpass $30 billion, cannibalizing 10% of marketing and cybersecurity budgets to combat a multifront threat. By 2027, 45% of chief information security officers (CISOs) will expand their remit beyond cybersecurity, due to increasing regulatory pressure and attack surface expansion. By 2028, the rate of unionization among knowledge workers will increase by 1,000%, motivated by the adoption of GenAI. In 2026, 30% of workers will leverage digital charisma filters to achieve previously unattainable advances in their careers. By 2027, 25% of Fortune 500 companies will actively recruit neurodivergent talent across conditions like autism, ADHD, and dyslexia to improve business performance. By 2028, there will be more smart robots than frontline workers in manufacturing, retail, and logistics due to labor shortages. By 2026, 50% of G20 members will experience monthly electricity rationing, turning energy-aware operations into either a competitive advantage or a major failure risk. By 2026, generative AI will significantly alter 70% of the design and development effort for new web applications and mobile apps. IDC believes that the tech industry is at a seminal moment. Never have we seen a technology emerge with this much executive support, clearly defined business outcomes, and rapid adoption. Also: These 5 major tech advances of 2023 were the biggest game-changers IDC has identified three broad types of generative AI use cases that need to be assessed that are industry specific, business function, and productivity-related. IDC notes that the landscape of business may be seeing a seismic shift with the rise of generative AI. IDC advises business leaders to start with the following solid foundation: Responsible AI policy: A well-defined AI policy that outlines principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, and data protection is paramount. AI strategy and roadmap and the role of the proof of concept: The AI strategy should include the rules or guidelines for generative AI proofs of concept (POCs), and it should incorporate the results of the POCs to recursively improve the strategy. Intelligent architecture: Data privacy, security, and intellectual property protection must also be embedded within this platform architecture. Reskilling and training: Most organizations do not have mature skill sets (prompt engineering, data science, data analysis, AI ethics, modeling) required to take full advantage of generative AI. IDC also notes that data serves as the foundation for generative AI. When IDC surveyed clients about their data, troubling results were revealed. 82% of organizations report siloed data (Future Enterprise Resiliency & Spending Survey). 41% cite that data is changing faster than they can keep up with (Global Data Valuation Survey). 24% do not trust their data (Future Enterprise Resiliency & Spending Survey). 29% have issues with data quality (Future Enterprise Resiliency & Spending Survey). By 2025, according to IDC, organizations will allocate over 40% of their core IT spend to AI-related initiatives, leading to a double-digit increase in the rate of product and process innovations. AI will radically reshape IT, according to IDC. Code generation, enterprise content management, marketing, and customer experience applications are some of the key areas for generative AI use cases in the enterprise, per IDC. IDC forecasts enterprise spending on GenAI services, software and infrastructure will grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $143 billion in 2027. Spending on generative AI over the four-year period to 2027 is expected to reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 73.3%. Forrester research points to the next generation of modern software development, where generative AI TuringBots speed and improve software development. Forrester defines TuringBots as: AI-powered software that augments application development and infrastructure and operations teams' automation and semiautonomous capabilities to plan, analyze, design, code, test, deliver, and deploy while providing assistive intelligence on code, development processes, and applications. Also: Today's AI boom will amplify social problems if we don't act now, says AI ethicist Forrester predicts that TuringBots will write 10% of worldwide code and tests. Here are additional Forrester generative AI predictions for the enterprise: One in four tech execs will report to their board on AI governance. Forrester's data shows that 46% of data and analytics business and technology decision-makers seek out partners to implement AI that's critical to the business. Ten percent of Fortune 500 enterprises will generate content with AI tools. Forrester predicts that Generative AI will be the fulcrum that businesses rely on to enhance, empower, and engage employees and customers -- with or without you. Forrester's predictions on AI include: Generative AI will seep into consumers' lives. Sixty percent of skeptics will use (and love) generative AI -- knowing it or not. AI will spur the age of creativity. Enterprise AI initiatives will boost productivity and creative problem-solving by 50%. Current AI projects already cite improvements of up to 40% in software development tasks. GenAI will augment customer service agents' capabilities. Customer Experience (CX) will improve for the first time in three years. Improvements will be most pronounced in Europe and APAC. In North America, the US will improve, while Canada will continue to struggle. Marketers will become privacy champions. CMOs at five large consumer brands will fund dedicated privacy resources. Yet, only 17% of privacy decision-makers say that their organization's privacy team has marketing competencies or skills. To bust this bottleneck, five large B2C brands will earmark a portion of their marketing budget specifically to fund additional headcount to the privacy team and/or upskill existing privacy colleagues. Generative AI dominated the top 10 emerging technologies of 2023 report by Forrester. The research notes that generative AI will strain most firms' ability to take risks and make good bets on emerging technology. Forrester research on the impact of generative AI on marketing notes the benefits of scale and precision to marketing. The research identifies the following benefits: 1. enhancing human intuition with intelligence; 2. amplifying creators' work; and 3. adding scale and speed to creative quality. Constellation Research believes generative AI will supercharge the future of work. The research notes that many work tasks will benefit from between a 1.3x to 5x gain in speed alone. Constellation research advice on the adoption of generative AI in the digital workplace is to have the following: Clear AI guidelines and policies Education and training AI governance structures Oversight and monitoring Collaboration and feedback Create clear ethical guidelines Conduct ethical impact assessments Monitor for AI bias Provide transparency Ensure compliance with regulations Constellation also provides a list of the leading generative AI enterprise grade solutions. Constellation also breaks down the impact of generative AI by industry. For the education industry, Constellation notes that Generative AI, which appears to be initially loved by students and loathed by educators, is coming to education as its embedded in courseware as well as learning-management systems. The overall forecasts are optimistic, but there are cautionary notes about guardrails for AI. Ventana Research highlights how generative AI helps sales and marketing in practical ways. Ventana notes: \"For marketing, one way this will happen is by improving the efficiency of marketing copy and potentially enabling personalization at scale. For field sales, the suggestions are that generative AI will improve both the ability of sales to craft emails for outreach and responses and to enhance presentations. Other use cases include using generative AI to summarize calls automatically and post them to the associated opportunity record, improving both accuracy and timeliness. This will have positive effects on sales productivity, but on its own will represent less a revolution than an evolution.\" By 2025, more than one-quarter of sales organizations will utilize generative AI to auto-summarize meetings, personalize outreach at scale, and generate tailored sales enablement to improve sales productivity and allow more time for direct sales engagement to improve win rates, according to Ventana. The use of AI to advance automation and enhance efficiency is another example of intelligent automation as a powerful tool for CIOs.

          "raw_content": "Real Madrid have named their squad for the Spanish Supercup semi-final against Atletico Madrid, including five Castilla players amongst their ranks. That is despite the fact their injury list has shrunk in recent weeks. Full-back Ferland Mendy trained on Sunday without issue, and has been named in the squad for Wednesday\u2019s game, and it means that \u2018only\u2019 Lucas Vazquez, Thibaut Courtois, David Alaba and Eder Militao are missing, which is a relative luxury for Carlo Ancelotti this season. Vinicius Junior, Aurelien Tchouameni and Toni Kroos also returned to the squad, the former two being rested for their Copa del Rey win over Arandina (3-1). Kroos has recovered from a minor ankle knock to make the squad. Defenders Vinicius Tobias and Alvaro Carrillo also remain in the squad after that match, as do midfielders Mario Martin, Nico Paz and goalkeeper Fran Gonzalez. Given their absences, Tobias and Carrillo have theoretically the best chances of making an appearance, but Ancelotti tends to err towards using senior players out of position rather than throwing youngsters in. Nico Paz could also see minutes \u2013 he has played the most of any of them this summer. With players coming back, Ancelotti has several decisions to make ahead of the Spanish Supercup. One of Andriy Lunin or Kepa Arrizabalaga will start behind a back four likely of Mendy, Nacho Fernandez, Antonio Rudiger and Dani Carvajal, although Eduardo Camavinga could be used back at left-back if Ancelotti does not feel Mendy is up to the challenge. Rodrygo Goes, Vinicius Junior, Fede Valverde and Jude Bellingham all seem nailed on to start, but it does leave Toni Kroos, Brahim Diaz and Aurelien Tchouameni all competing for two positions \u2013 Camavinga could of course feature in the middle of the pitch too.",

          "raw_content": "The new soccer season brings optimism for many top European teams, each aiming to become the very best in the world. Some teams, such as Manchester City, are pushing to compete against what they accomplished last season. Others, such as Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, aim to win back trophies that went to their rivals instead. While the most crucial position for a team is finishing as high as possible at the end of the season, teams that start well are already on their way to accomplishing their goals. Below is our ranking of the five best soccer teams in the world in the early part of the 2023-2024 season. 1. Manchester City Whenever you look at football betting odds, Manchester City is a favorite for any game or competition. Last season\u2019s treble winners hope to repeat that feat or perform even better this term. City will have a chance to win the Club World Cup while defending their Premier League, Champions League, and FA Cup trophies. The League Cup is one competition they will not be able to win, as Newcastle United has already eliminated them. A solid start in the Premier League, where they will be at the top of the table at the end of the weekend, is accompanied by assured displays in the Champions League. No team has ever won two consecutive trebles, but City is the one team that may achieve the unthinkable. 2. Bayern Munich If there is one side in Europe that can match Manchester City at its very best, it may be Bayern Munich. The German giants were not at their best last term, as they needed a final-day disaster from Borussia Dortmund to hold onto their Bundesliga crown. The Champions League was not much better for Bayern last term, as City thumped them over two legs. Bayern have, however, started this season very promisingly. They are in a good position in the Bundesliga, while their Champions League campaign is also on track. The addition of Harry Kane from Tottenham may be the one move that gives them a huge chance to win the Champions League this season. 3. Barcelona Last season\u2019s La Liga winners struggled significantly in European competitions under coach Xavi Hernandez. While they dominated in Spain, including against rivals Real Madrid, they were bundled out of the Champions League in the group stages. They lost their first tie to Manchester United, even in the Europa League. Significant summer recruitment has seen Barca improve their squad even further. Ilkay Gundogan and Joao Cancelo are outstanding trophy winners who will take the team to another level. While the main aim for the Catalan giants is to repeat their Spanish league win, they will be hoping to do much better in Europe. Reaching the quarter-finals or semi-finals of the Champions League is a significant ambition. 4. Real Madrid Los Blancos had a disaster of a 2022-2023 season by their high standards, as they did not win La Liga or the Champions League. Europe\u2019s most successful team in history was far from Barcelona in their domestic league, while Manchester City was too good for them to beat in the Champions League. Real surprised many people by not investing in a center forward this summer, even after losing Karim Benzema to the Saudi Pro League. While Benzema\u2019s goals are a miss, Real has started the season strongly. The Madrid giants are currently top of La Liga as of Saturday night, with Atletico Madrid able to close the gap if they win their game in hand. 5. Liverpool The Merseyside giants struggled last season, which shocked many of their supporters. Having nearly won four trophies in the 2021-2022 season, Liverpool were far adrift of significant honors in 2022-2023. Manager Jurgen Klopp may have waited too long to refresh his midfield, as a lack of energy in the middle of the park meant they were bundled out of every cup competition early. While Liverpool are not in this season\u2019s Champions League, they can win the Europa League. They have also invested heavily in their team in the summer, adding youth, energy, and creativity to their midfield. They have started the season with a bang and are serious contenders to win the Premier League title. The quality throughout the European game is as high as in the past. The above five teams are not the only ones in contention to win their domestic leagues and European trophies. Topsides such as Arsenal, Newcastle United, and Borussia Dortmund have also started the season impressively. While every other side in Europe is still chasing Manchester City, there is early-season optimism that Pep Guardiola\u2019s side can be caught. They have already lost to Arsenal in the Premier League, but they have yet to face a top side in the Champions League. Whoever comes out on top, we are in for a very entertaining and action-packed season in the coming months.",

          "raw_content": "Part of college basketball's beauty is its unpredictability. Just one year after the 2022 NCAA Tournament produced a blue blood special of Duke, North Carolina, Villanova and Kansas in the Final Four, the 2023 Big Dance veered hard in an unexpected direction. The Final Four featured three first-time guests -- FAU, Miami and San Diego State -- along with No. 4 seed and eventual national champion UConn. UConn, Miami and FAU were unranked to begin last season, while San Diego State was 19th. Meanwhile, North Carolina became the first preseason No. 1 team to ever miss the NCAA Tournament. Now, with the arrival of the 2023-24 season, it's time to embrace the possibilities once again. When the ball is tipped Monday around the country, it will mark the beginning of a five-month journey that will culminate in Glendale, Arizona, for the 2024 Final Four. Opinions on who will be at State Farm Stadium on the first weekend of April vary tremendously within our panel of six experts here at CBS Sports. Collectively, we've picked 13 teams to reach the Final Four, with three different teams coming out on top as national champions. Below, you'll find those attempts to predict what's in store for the thoroughly unpredictable sport of college basketball in the 2023-24 season. 2024 Final Four predictions Predicted champions Kansas: The Jayhawks have won two national championships under Bill Self and would've been the favorite in 2020 if not for a global pandemic leading to the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament. Now, here they are again, No. 1 in the preseason AP Top 25 and the favorite in betting markets to win the 2024 NCAA Tournament largely because of Self's presence, the return of starters Dajuan Harris, Kevin McCullar and K.J. Adams and the addition of transfers Hunter Dickinson and Nick Timberlake. Kansas has talent, experience, depth and a coach who has been labeled the best in the sport by a panel of CBS Sports writers and analysts two straight years. That's a great combination and why I believe the Jayhawks are the team most likely to win the national championship, which would make Self just the seventh Division I men's coach in history to claim three NCAA Tournament titles. -- Gary Parrish (also David Cobb, Jerry Palm) Purdue: There have only been two No. 1 seeds in NCAA Tournament history to lose to a No. 16 seed. One was Virginia in 2018, but the Cavaliers rebounded in the best way possible by winning the NCAA championship the following year. The other is Purdue in 2023, and I believe the Boilermakers can replicate Virginia's follow-up. Purdue has the biggest weapon in the sport -- reigning Player of the Year Zach Edey -- and a more experienced supporting cast that has all the chips on all the shoulders to come back better this season. The majority of the team's core is back in place this season, and with an offseason to process and improve upon a heartbreaking postseason loss, I'm betting Purdue finds a way to turn this into a feel-good story for the ages. -- Kyle Boone (also Matt Norlander) Duke: Duke brings back four starters from a team that won the ACC title in Jon Scheyer's first season at the helm, and the program parlayed that success on the recruiting trail by bringing in the No. 2 overall class. Guard play still matters in March, and Tyrese Proctor, Jeremy Roach and Jared McCain are the three standouts at the position. The 2023-24 season is still the year of the big man, and it's hard to argue against Kyle Filipowski being the No. 2 overall player behind reigning National Player of the Year Zach Edey. The Blue Devils have a combination of experience and youth that makes the perfect recipe for a national title returning to Durham, North Carolina. -- Cameron Salerno Predicted Final Four teams FAU: The biggest mistake some make while discussing FAU is insisting the Owls \"just got hot in the NCAA Tournament to make the Final Four\" rather than acknowledging that they were just really good all season. FAU went 35-4 while playing in a league with two other top-50 KenPom teams. The Owls won their conference by multiple games. They won the title game of their conference tournament by 22 points. They beat the Memphis team that beat Houston in the AAC Tournament, beat the Tennessee team that eliminated Duke from the NCAA Tournament and beat the Kansas State team that eliminated Kentucky and Michigan State from the NCAA Tournament. Now, all five starters are back from that incredibly accomplished team, which is why there's nothing crazy about suggesting Florida Atlantic really does have the coach and players to make back-to-back Final Fours even though the program had zero NCAA Tournament wins in history prior to its run last March. -- Parrish Texas A&M: My Final Four picks are annually a package of teams that I intentionally choose to NOT all be ranked in the top 4/5/6 of my annual top 101 rankings. Keep in mind, with one exception (2007-08), the four Final Four teams were not ranked in the preseason top five. So, I'm looking for realistic picks that aren't obvious acros the board. I am the only one of the six here to pick A&M to go to Glendale. I like the Aggies' chances to win the SEC a year removed from finishing second with a 15-3 record and returning the fourth-highest percentage of minutes-getters in high-major basketball (Wisconsin, Purdue and Marquette, per BartTorvik.com). Look for junior lead guard Wade Taylor IV to emerge as one of the best backcourt scorers in the nation. One caveat here, though: My A&M pick was made before it was revealed that Julius Marble is currently away from the team for reasons that haven't been disclosed. His role is a major one to A&M's season-long viability, so we await more with that. (If Marble winds up not being on the team, I would tap Marquette as a sub here.) -- Norlander Texas: You're seeing some love for second-year coach Jon Scheyer in our preseason Final Four picks, but let me give second-year Texas coach Rodney Terry -- who is in his first season as the full-time leader of the Longhorns -- some support. Texas was a No. 2 seed last season and made the Elite Eight, finishing fifth at KenPom in the process. That's a great year. The Longhorns brought on one of the best scorers in the country, Max Abmas from Oral Roberts, and could have an elite two-way guard in the Big 12 with junior Tyrese Hunter. Dillon Mitchell had a soft opening as a freshman; look for him to pop. Dylan Disu's all-around value is about to become a lot more realized, too. I don't think Texas will win the Big 12, but I do think it's going to rack up Quad 1 wins and put itself in position to be on the 2-, 3- or 4-seed line. A team with all of the pieces to win four in the Big Dance, no doubt. -- Norlander Kentucky: Kentucky has not made it to the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament since 2019. It has lost to Kansas State, Saint Peter's and also missed the tourney entirely since then. So, the momentum for UK under John Calipari isn't there right now. I get it. But talent still matters more than I think the casual fan would care to acknowledge, and Kentucky has it in spades. Even with a completely suspect frontcourt thanks to preseason injuries, the Wildcats have two potential stars in Justin Edwards and DJ Wagner \u2014 the core pieces of a top-five incoming recruiting class. With Antonio Reeves back, there's a nice blend of experience and elite youthful talent to help Calipari get things back on track in Lexington. -- Boone UConn: Haters will point to the fact that going to back-to-back Final Fours is historically unlikely; the last team to do so was those mid-aughts Florida teams under Billy Donovan. The haters don't know Dan Hurley, though. UConn lost Adama Sanogo and Jordan Hawkins from its title-winning team, but the nucleus of Tristen Newton, Alex Karaban and Donovan Clingan are back combined with the arrival of potential one-and-done freshman Stephon Castle. This team will again have size, length and tremendous guard play \u2014 the recipe of a team that could, and I think will, be back in the Final Four this season. -- Boone Michigan State: Michigan State's combination of returning production and young talent is the perfect mix in today's era. The Spartans can turn to veteran guards like Tyson Walker, A.J. Hoggard and Jaden Akins in clutch moments and for consistent production. As the veterans guide the ship, a trio of top-50 freshmen can acclimate to the college game and blossom into key roles in time to shine by March. Tom Izzo has guided the Spartans to 25 straight NCAA Tournament appearances, including 15 Sweet 16s and eight Final Fours. This group has all the ingredients needed to add to his legacy. -- Cobb Arizona: Arizona is 61-11 (32-8 Pac-12) and has earned a No. 1 seed and No. 2 seed for the NCAA Tournament over the past two seasons to begin coach Tommy Lloyd's tenure. The Wildcats have made early exits from the Big Dance under Lloyd, but this team can be different. Former North Carolina guard Caleb Love has been to a national title game, so has San Diego State transfer forward Keshad Johnson. Both should be starters and will combine with a solid returning core of Kylan Boswell, Pelle Larsson and Oumar Ballo to give Lloyd another lethal offensive team. If Ballo can shine as the centerpiece of the frontcourt, the Wildcats will dance from their home in Tucson to a Final Four appearance just up the road in Glendale. -- Cobb (also Norlander) Marquette: Marquette was one of the pleasant surprises from last season. The Golden Eagles won the Big East regular season and tournament titles before earning a 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament. They fell victim to Michigan State in the second round, but almost everyone is back to give it another go. This season, like last, they are led by reigning Big East Player of the year Tyler Kolek. Marquette went nine deep last year and Kolek is joined by seven other returning Golden Eagles from last season's rotation. The only player who left was Olivier-Maxence Prosper, who is now prospering (pun intended) in the NBA. The Big East figures to be highly competitive again this season, so a top seed in the NCAA Tournament may be too much to ask, but Shaka Smart's crew will be well prepared for a deep run in the NCAA Tournament. -- Palm Creighton: Creighton was seconds away from reaching its first Final Four in program history before San Diego State's Darrion Trammell knocked down a free throw that sent the Bluejays packing. Creighton brings back the best trio in the Big East in Ryan Kalkbrenner, Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander, and it added Utah State transfer Steven Ashworth to replace former point guard Ryan Nembhard. The Big East will be a grind, and there are three teams -- UConn, Marquette and Creighton -- that all have a legit chance of reaching the final weekend of the season. This is the year the Bluejays get over the hump, largely because of their returning experience. -- Salerno (also Boone)",

The uncertainty around Dominguez's performance and the potential for other players to qualify through different paths adds complexity to the forecast.\n\nGiven that Wesley So is currently leading Dominguez by a single rating point and Dominguez needs to perform well in Sitges to surpass him, the probability of So participating in the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament is moderately high but not certain.

Wesley So's current rating lead, although slim, provides a significant advantage. The uncertainty around Dominguez's performance in Sitges and the potential for other players to qualify through different paths should be factored in, but the likelihood of So maintaining his position is still relatively high.\n\nGiven the cautious considerations and the inherent uncertainties in tournament outcomes, the initial probability of 0.65 seems reasonable. However, it is essential to remain conservative and account for the potential overestimation of Dominguez's chances.\n\nFinal forecast: 0.65\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.65*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "GM Leinier Dominguez has arrived in Spain where he will play the Chessable Sunway Sitges Chess Festival to battle for a coveted spot in the Candidates tournament. This week the Cuban-born American, currently the world's seventh-ranked player, confirmed his participation in the open tournament in Sitges, Spain, half an hour's drive from Barcelona, bringing a new level of excitement to the 10th edition of the event. \"It's great news for us that Leinier is here, particularly taking into account that it's our 10th anniversary this edition,\" Chief Organizer Oskar Stober Bl\u00e1zquez told Chess.com. \"We have had some some great players here in recent years, but to have someone who is fighting for his spot in the Candidates, a top-ten player, could never be a realistic goal, so it's great to have this option. Personally I feel kind of \"bad\" for him that he has to play an open tournament, but on the other hand I'm obviously glad that we get to have him here,\" Stober added. All eyes in Sitges will be on Dominguez, the clear rating favorite among the 36 grandmasters participating, The 40-year-old is fighting for a spot in the 2024 FIDE Candidates tournament, where six out of eight players have already secured their places. Two spots remain up for grabs, with one reserved for the highest-rated player on FIDE's January 2024 rating list. Currently GM Wesley So leads that race by one rating point ahead of Dominguez, but while So is likely done playing this year, Dominguez has set his eyes on the open tournament with one mission: gain rating points. The 40-year-old entered the race by finishing second in the recent Sinquefield Cup, where he gained 11 rating points and climbed to world number-seven. \"It's a nice chance. It's not every day you get a chance to fight for the Candidates. I will do it,\" he said during the broadcast in St. Louis. According to FIDE's regulations, Dominguez will likely need to play at least five of the rounds in Sitges, but chess statistician Tai Pruce-Zimmerman, who follows the race to the Candidates closely on X/Twitter account Chess by the Numbers, says he is bound to make it if he just gains one rating point during those rounds. \"I haven't seen a clarification from FIDE on how a tie for the rating spot would be broken. I believe typically the player with the most games played in the most recent month is listed higher on a given rating list. If that is how a rating tie is to be broken then if Dominguez simply plays Sitges, and gains at least one rating point, he will pass So for the ratings-based Candidates qualifying spot,\" he says. GM Anish Giri is still in pole-position for the FIDE Circuit spot, as GM Gukesh Dommaraju was unsuccessful in his attempt to catch up by winning the London Chess Classic. The youngster could get another chance to qualify through the Chennai Grandm Masters in India, a mysterious tournament scheduled to begin on December 15. The field there is yet to be announced, but according to German blogger Perlen vom Bodensee, Gukesh is likely to take part in the event, along with GMs Parham Maghsoodloo, Pavel Eljanov, Levon Aronian, Arjun Erigaisi and several others.",

          "raw_content": "The traditional London Chess Classic started on Friday, and Hans Niemann, the most controversial character in the game, arrived at the board in the form of his life. The US 20-year-old, who made headlines when the world No 1, Magnus Carlsen, refused to play him, and who subsequently launched a $100m lawsuit against Carlsen and others, has been in constant action since their out of court settlement three months ago. Niemann\u2019s form had dipped below the 2700 elite grandmaster level, but he performed well in the recent Grand Swiss and US Championships before his stellar and career-best success at Zagreb, Croatia, this week, where he outclassed a strong field, winning first prize by a three-point margin in a complex, confident style. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Niemann provocatively compared himself to Bobby Fischer, who had also won in Zagreb in 1970 during his world title campaign which led to his 1972 victory over Boris Spassky. Kresimir Podravec, the secretary of the Zagreb Chess Federation, which organised the tournament, is reported to have told the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten after round seven: \u201cNiemann\u2019s result is out of this world, but we have no definite proof that he cheated. We have some indications, but we don\u2019t know if anyone wants to report him.\u201d Others then pointed out that the organisers were themselves responsible for anti-cheating measures, but had failed to include any apart from a delay to the online game transmission. The London Classic, where Niemann competed on Friday, is expected to have full anti-cheating procedures including body scanners. The American\u2019s performance rating after scoring 8/9 was 2946. This number is not far behind the three greatest results in modern tournament history, Fabiano Caruana\u2019s 3098 in the 2014 Sinquefield Cup, Carlsen\u2019s 3002 at Pearl Springs, China, in 2008, and Anatoly Karpov\u2019s 2985 at Linares, Spain, in 1994. All were much stronger events than Zagreb, but the quality of Niemann\u2019s games has been impressive. Niemann defeated the top seed, Anton Korobov, in Thursday\u2019s morning\u2019s final round by a classic 39-move checkmating attack on the Ukrainian\u2019s king, before taking the three-hour flight from Zagreb to London, where the Classic began at 2pm on Friday. Four of his other highlights were: victory over Vasyl Ivanchuk, where Niemann\u2019s king\u2019s rook performed a nine-move dance round the board before ending at d8 with an unstoppable mate threat; a tactical Modern Benoni against Zdenko Kozul, played in the style of Mikhail Tal; an underpromotion to knight against Robert Zelcic, with the surprise decider 46 Nh6!; and a 25-move miniature against Ivan Cheparinov, where one white knight was trapped on the rim at a4 by b7-b5 and the other was trapped at h4 by g7-g5. Not all the losers took defeat well. According to observers of the live feed, Cheparinov just got up, took his coat and was gone. Ivan Sokolov, Uzbekistan\u2019s Olympiad gold medal trainer and former champion of Yugoslavia and the Netherlands, who had criticised Niemann for his admitted historical cheating in online events, offered his hand after the game, but did not look at or speak to the American. Later, Sokolov took to X and posted: \u201cIt is hard to fight 98 accuracy. There are (apart from delay) no anti-cheating measures. Not even a scan.\u201d Hikaru Nakamura, the world No 3, told his YouTube subscribers that \u201cHans having a great tournament made sense, because he started well and tends to be a streaky player.\u201d Jacob Aagaard, the former British champion and chess author, wrote that Niemann had made some errors but \u201cno gross blunders. These are the types of mistakes that get you into trouble at 2750, He is a 2700 player, facing 2600 average and having a good run.\u201d On Friday afternoon in London, Niemann participated in a much higher class tournament than Zagreb, so it will be interesting to see if he can maintain his frenetic pace. Nine grandmasters and an ambitious 14-year-old compete in the Classic for a prize fund of nearly \u00a340,000. The event will not be open to spectators due to space restrictions, but can be followed online from 2pm daily via the tournament website or at other leading chess sites. Dommaraju Gukesh is the top seed despite his recent poor form, and the 17-year-old Indian still has a chance of qualifying for the 2024 eight-player Candidates in Toronto, particularly if rumours are correct that a special tournament will be organised in mid-December to improve India\u2019s chances of fielding a third Candidate besides Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi. If the top seed misfires, England\u2019s new No 1, Nikita Vitiugov, who won the 2021 Russian championship then emigrated and changed federations in response to the war with Ukraine, has a serious chance. The 36-year-old, whose new home is in East Anglia, impressed at the Fide Grand Swiss on the Isle of Man, where only a defeat in the final round kept him out of a high place, and again at the European teams last month. Vitiugov is strong in opening preparation, having helped Peter Svidler in Candidates tournaments and Ian Nepomniachtchi in his two world title matches. England\u2019s other representatives in the Classic are Michael Adams, the eight-time British and now world over-50 senior champion, Luke McShane, who narrowly missed a board prize at the European teams where he was England\u2019s top scorer, and Shreyas Royal, the 14-year-old from Greenwich who already has one GM norm and missed a second norm on the Isle of Man by just half a point. In 1980 Nigel Short, then also 14, made his debut, also in London, in a top tournament. Short finished last then, but 13 years later he was challenging Garry Kasparov, again in London, for the world crown. In Friday\u2019s opening round of the London Classic, Gukesh beat Mateusz Bartel (Poland) and Adams won against Mohammad Amin Tabatabaei (Iran) , while three draws included Jules Moussard (France) v Niemann. The American halved easily as Black in a Ruy Lopez Berlin. Fabiano Caruana, the world No 2, won the traditional Sinquefield Cup in St Louis on Thursday, raised his Fide rating to over 2800, and confirmed that he will be the favourite for next year\u2019s Candidates, for which he has qualified by three different routes. Final leading scores were Caruana 5.5/8, Leinier Dom\u00ednguez 5, Wesley So 4.5. Alireza Firouzja was next to last on 3/8. Caruana won a 25-move miniature against So. The Fide Circuit and rating spots for the eight-player 2024 Candidates, which will decide the next challenger for Ding Liren\u2019s world crown, remain undecided. Alireza Firouzja had seemed assured of the rating place, but the 20-year-old Frenchman has performed poorly in St Louis. The rating contest is now close: So 2757, Dom\u00ednguez 2756, Firouzja 2750, Anish Giri 2749, while Giri, Gukesh and So are the leading Circuit contenders It is an individual race, but in the background there is an implicit struggle for national supremacy between the two chess superpowers, India and the United States. They currently each have two Candidates, Vidit and Praggnanadhaa for India and Caruana and Nakamura for the US. A third qualifier for either or both nations could tilt the balance in what looks like an open contest in Toronto, so the race for the final two Candidates places may continue until the last few days of December.",

    "question": "Will OpenAI publicly commit to an anonymous process to raise risks as part of the \"right to warn\" principles before July 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "On June 4, 2024, a group of current and former employees at frontier AI labs called for \"[sweeping changes to the artificial intelligence industry, including greater transparency and protections for whistle-blowers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/technology/openai-culture-whistleblowers.html?unlocked_article_code=1.xE0._mTr.aNO4f_hEp2J4&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=c-cb).\"\n\nIn a public statement titled \"[A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence](https://righttowarn.ai/),\" the group said:\n\n> We are current and former employees at frontier AI companies, and we believe in the potential of AI technology to deliver unprecedented benefits to humanity.\n\n> We also understand the serious risks posed by these technologies. These risks range from the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction. AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].\n\n> We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry. We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.\n\n> **We therefore call upon advanced AI companies to commit to these principles.**\n\n> 1. **That the company will not enter into or enforce** any agreement that prohibits \u201cdisparagement\u201d or criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, nor retaliate for risk-related criticism by hindering any vested economic benefit;\n2. **That the company will facilitate a verifiably anonymous process** for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise;\n3. **That the company will support a culture of open criticism** and allow its current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns about its technologies to the public, to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, or to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise, so long as trade secrets and other intellectual property interests are appropriately protected;\n4. **That the company will not retaliate against current and former employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.** We accept that any effort to report risk-related concerns should avoid releasing confidential information unnecessarily. Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially. However, as long as such a process does not exist, current and former employees should retain their freedom to report their concerns to the public.",

      "<facts>\n1. On June 4, 2024, a group of current and former employees from frontier AI labs, including OpenAI, called for sweeping changes in the AI industry, emphasizing greater transparency and protections for whistleblowers.\n2. The group issued a public statement titled \"A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence,\" advocating for four principles: prohibiting non-disparagement agreements, establishing an anonymous process for raising concerns, fostering a culture of open criticism, and ensuring no retaliation against employees who disclose risks after other processes fail.\n3. OpenAI has faced internal criticism and staff departures, with former employees expressing concerns over the company's approach to AI risks and restrictive non-disclosure agreements.\n4. OpenAI has acknowledged the importance of rigorous debate on AI implications and has mentioned existing measures like a tipline for reporting issues and a safety committee.\n5. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that the company had never clawed back equity and later removed non-disparagement clauses from separation agreements.\n6. The letter has received support from notable AI experts like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, emphasizing the need for reform in AI governance.\n7. The letter highlights that AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight and that existing whistleblower protections are inadequate for unregulated risks.\n8. OpenAI has announced it will release past employees from non-disparagement agreements linked to their equity.\n</facts>\n\n<no>\n1. **Commercial Pressures (8/10)**: OpenAI has significant financial incentives to avoid additional oversight and transparency measures that could slow down product development or reveal proprietary information.\n2. **Existing Measures (6/10)**: OpenAI may argue that its current measures, such as the tipline and safety committee, are sufficient, reducing the perceived need for additional commitments.\n3. **Internal Resistance (5/10)**: There may be internal resistance within OpenAI's leadership to adopt new policies that could be seen as conceding to external pressure or admitting past failures.\n4. **Industry Norms (4/10)**: The broader AI industry may not be ready to adopt such principles, and OpenAI might be reluctant to act unilaterally without similar commitments from other major players.\n</no>\n\n<yes>\n1. **Public Pressure (7/10)**: The public and media attention generated by the open letter and support from notable AI experts could pressure OpenAI to commit to the proposed principles to maintain its reputation.\n2. **Employee Morale (6/10)**: Adopting these principles could improve employee morale and retention, addressing some of the internal criticisms and staff departures.\n3. **Regulatory Environment (5/10)**: Anticipating future regulatory requirements, OpenAI might see early adoption of these principles as a proactive step to align with potential government oversight.\n4. **Support from AI Experts (5/10)**: The endorsement from respected AI figures like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton could lend credibility to the call for change, influencing OpenAI's decision.\n</yes>\n\n<thinking>\nThe competing factors involve balancing commercial pressures and the need for transparency and accountability. OpenAI's significant financial incentives to avoid additional oversight are strong, but public and internal pressures could push the company towards adopting the proposed principles. The existing measures like the tipline and safety committee might be seen as sufficient by OpenAI, but the public and expert support for the open letter adds weight to the call for change. The broader industry norms and potential internal resistance are also factors that could hinder OpenAI's commitment. However, the potential benefits in terms of employee morale and alignment with future regulatory requirements could incentivize OpenAI to adopt the principles.\n</thinking>\n\n<cautious>\nThe sources may be biased towards emphasizing the urgency and severity of the risks associated with AI, given the dramatic language used and the focus on high-profile endorsements. The media often highlights conflicts and controversies, which could exaggerate the internal tensions and the necessity for immediate action. Additionally, the support from AI experts, while notable, may not fully represent the broader industry's stance on these issues. The potential for overestimating the impact of public and expert pressure should be considered, as well as the possibility that OpenAI's existing measures might be more robust than portrayed.\n</cautious>\n\n<tentative>\n0.45\n</tentative>\n\n<thinking>\nReflecting on the initial probability, it's important to consider the base rate of companies making such public commitments under similar circumstances. While the specific context of AI and the high-profile nature of the open letter add weight to the argument for a higher probability, the commercial pressures and existing measures at OpenAI suggest a more conservative estimate. The potential for overestimating the impact of public and expert pressure, as well as the possibility that OpenAI's current measures are deemed sufficient, should temper the initial forecast. Given these considerations, the final probability should reflect a balanced view of the competing factors.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n*0.45*\n</answer>"

          "raw_content": "A handful of current and former employees at OpenAI and other prominent artificial intelligence companies warned that the technology poses grave risks to humanity in a Tuesday letter, calling on companies to implement sweeping changes to ensure transparency and foster a culture of public debate. The letter, signed by 13 people including current and former employees at Anthropic and Google\u2019s DeepMind, said AI can exacerbate inequality, increase misinformation, and allow AI systems to become autonomous and cause significant death. Though these risks could be mitigated, corporations in control of the software have \u201cstrong financial incentives\u201d to limit oversight, they said. Because AI is only loosely regulated, accountability rests on company insiders, the employees wrote, calling on corporations to lift nondisclosure agreements and give workers protections that allow them to anonymously raise concerns. Advertisement The move comes as OpenAI faces a staff exodus. Many critics have seen prominent departures \u2014 including of OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and senior researcher Jan Leike \u2014 as a rebuke of company leaders, who some employees argue chase profit at the expense of making OpenAI\u2019s technologies safer. Daniel Kokotajlo, a former employee at OpenAI, said he left the start-up because of the company\u2019s disregard for the risks of artificial intelligence. \u201cI lost hope that they would act responsibly, particularly as they pursue artificial general intelligence,\u201d he said in a statement, referencing a hotly contested term referring to computers matching the power of human brains. \u201cThey and others have bought into the \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 approach, and that is the opposite of what is needed for technology this powerful and this poorly understood,\u201d Kokotajlo said. Advertisement Liz Bourgeois, a spokesperson at OpenAI, said the company agrees that \u201crigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology.\u201d Representatives from Anthropic and Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The employees said that absent government oversight, AI workers are the \u201cfew people\u201d who can hold corporations accountable. They said that they are hamstrung by \u201cbroad confidentiality agreements\u201d and that ordinary whistleblower protections are \u201cinsufficient\u201d because they focus on illegal activity, and the risks that they are warning about are not yet regulated. The letter called for AI companies to commit to four principles to allow for greater transparency and whistleblower protections. Those principles are a commitment to not enter into or enforce agreements that prohibit criticism of risks; a call to establish an anonymous process for current and former employees to raise concerns; supporting a culture of criticism; and a promise to not retaliate against current and former employees who share confidential information to raise alarms \u201cafter other processes have failed.\u201d Advertisement The Washington Post in December reported that senior leaders at OpenAI raised fears about retaliation from CEO Sam Altman \u2014 warnings that preceded the chief\u2019s temporary ouster. In a recent podcast interview, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner said part of the nonprofit\u2019s decision to remove Altman as CEO late last year was his lack of candid communication about safety. \u201cHe gave us inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place, meaning that it was basically just impossible for the board to know how well those safety processes were working,\u201d she told \u201cThe TED AI Show\u201d in May. The letter was endorsed by AI luminaries including Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who are considered \u201cgodfathers\u201d of AI, and renowned computer scientist Stuart Russell.",

          "raw_content": "A group of current and former employees at prominent artificial intelligence companies issued an open letter on Tuesday that warned of a lack of safety oversight within the industry and called for increased protections for whistleblowers. The letter, which calls for a \u201cright to warn about artificial intelligence\u201d, is one of the most public statements about the dangers of AI from employees within what is generally a secretive industry. Eleven current and former OpenAI workers signed the letter, along with two current or former Google DeepMind employees \u2013 one of whom previously worked at Anthropic. \u201cAI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHowever, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\u201d OpenAI defended its practices in a statement, saying that it had avenues such as a tipline to report issues at the company and that it did not release new technology until there were appropriate safeguards. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we\u2019ll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said. Concern over the potential harms of artificial intelligence have existed for decades, but the AI boom of recent years has intensified those fears and left regulators scrambling to catch up with technological advancements. While AI companies have publicly stated their commitment to safely developing the technology, researchers and employees have warned about a lack of oversight as AI tools exacerbate existing social harms or create entirely new ones. The letter from current and former AI company employees, which was first reported by the New York Times, calls for increased protections for workers at advanced AI companies who decide to voice safety concerns. It asks for a commitment to four principles around transparency and accountability, including a provision that companies will not force employees to sign any non-disparagement agreements that prohibit airing risk-related AI issues and a mechanism for employees to anonymously share concerns with board members. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,\u201d the letter states. \u201cYet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.\u201d Companies such as OpenAI have also pursued aggressive tactics to prevent employees from speaking freely about their work, with Vox reporting last week that OpenAI made employees who leave the company sign extremely restrictive non-disparagement and non-disclosure documents or lose all their vested equity. Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, apologized following the report, saying that he would change off-boarding procedures. The letter comes after two top OpenAI employees, co-founder Ilya Sutskever and key safety researcher Jan Leike, resigned from the company last month. After his departure, Leike alleged that OpenAI had abandoned a culture of safety in favor of \u201cshiny products\u201d. The open letter on Tuesday echoed some of Leike\u2019s statement, saying that companies did not display any obligation to be transparent about their operations.",

They also called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as the law struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. Companies have acknowledged the \u201cserious risks\u201d posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control, known as \u201csingularity,\u201d that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but they should be be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures, the group wrote. As the law currently stands, the AI employees said, they don\u2019t believe AI companies will share critical information about the technology voluntarily. It\u2019s essential, then, for current and former employees to speak up \u2014 and for companies not to enforce \u201cdisparagement\u201d agreements or otherwise retaliate against those who voice risk-related concerns. \u201cOrdinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated,\u201d the group wrote. Their letter comes as companies move quickly to implement generative AI tools into their products, while government regulators, companies and consumers grapple with responsible use. Meanwhile many tech experts, researchers and leaders have called for a temporary pause in the AI race, or for the government to step in and create a moratorium. OpenAI\u2019s response In response to the letter, OpenAI spokesperson told CNN it is \u201cproud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk, adding that the company agrees \u201crigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology.\u201d OpenAI noted it has an anonymous integrity hotline and a Safety and Security Committee led by members of its board and safety leaders from the company. The company does not sell personal info, build user profiles, or use that data to target anyone or sell anything. But Daniel Ziegler, one of the organizers behind the letter and an early machine-learning engineer who worked at OpenAI between 2018 and 2021, told CNN that it\u2019s important to remain skeptical of the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell from the outside how seriously they\u2019re taking their commitments for safety evaluations and figuring out societal harms, especially as there is such strong commercial pressures to move very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have the right culture and processes so that employees can speak out in targeted ways when they have concerns.\u201d He hopes more professionals in the AI industry will go public with their concerns as a result of the letter.

          "raw_content": "Eleven current and former employees of OpenAI, along with two more from Google DeepMind, posted an open letter today stating that they are unable to voice concerns about risks created by their employees due to confidentiality agreements. Today let\u2019s talk about what they said, what they left out, and why lately the AI safety conversation feels like it\u2019s going nowhere. Here\u2019s a dynamic we\u2019ve seen play out a few times now at companies including Meta, Google, and Twitter. First, in a bid to address potential harms created by their platforms, companies hire idealistic workers and charge them with building safeguards into their systems. For a while, the work of these teams gets prioritized. But over time, executives\u2019 enthusiasm wanes, commercial incentives take over, and the team is gradually de-funded. When those roadblocks go up, some of the idealistic employees will speak out, either to a reporter like me, or via the sort of open letter that the AI workers published today. And the company responds by reorganizing the team out of existence, while putting out a statement saying that whatever that team used to work on is now everyone\u2019s responsibility. At Meta, this process gave us the whistleblower Frances Haugen. On Google\u2019s AI ethics team, a slightly different version of the story played out after the firing of researcher Timnit Gebru. And in 2024, the story came to the AI industry. OpenAI arguably set itself up for this moment more than those other tech giants. After all, it was established not as a traditional for-profit enterprise, but as a nonprofit research lab devoted to safely building an artificial general intelligence. OpenAI\u2019s status as a relatively obscure nonprofit changed forever in November 2022. That\u2019s when it released ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the latest version of its large language model, which by some estimates soon became the fastest-growing consumer product in history. ChatGPT took a technology that had been exclusively the province of nerds and put it in the hands of everyone from elementary school children to state-backed foreign influence operations. And OpenAI soon barely resembled the nonprofit that was founded out of a fear that AI poses an existential risk to humanity. This OpenAI placed a premium on speed. It pushed the frontier forward with tools like plugins, which connected ChatGPT to the wider internet. It aggressively courted developers. Less than a year after ChatGPT\u2019s release, the company \u2014 a for-profit subsidiary of its nonprofit parent \u2014 was valued at $90 billion. That transformation, led by CEO Sam Altman, gave many in the company whiplash. And it was at the heart of the tensions that led the nonprofit board to fire Altman last year, for reasons related to governance. The five-day interregnum between Altman\u2019s firing and his return marked a pivotal moment for the company. The board could have recommitted to its original vision of slow, cautious development of powerful AI systems. Or it could endorse the post-ChatGPT version of OpenAI, which closely resembled a traditional Silicon Valley venture-backed startup. Almost immediately, it became clear that a vast majority of employees preferred working at a more traditional startup. Among other things, that startup\u2019s commercial prospects meant that their (unusual) equity in the company would be worth millions of dollars. The vast majority of OpenAI employees threatened to quit if Altman didn\u2019t return. And so Altman returned. Most of the old board left. New, more business-minded board members replaced them. And that board has stood by Altman in the months that followed, even as questions mount about his complex business dealings and conflicts of interest. Most employees seem content under the new regime; positions at OpenAI are still highly sought after. But like Meta and Google before it, OpenAI had its share of conscientious objectors. And increasingly, we\u2019re hearing what they think. The latest wave began last month when OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who initially backed Altman\u2019s firing and who had focused on AI safety efforts, quit the company. He was followed out the door by Jan Leike, who led the superalignment team, and a handful of other employees who worked on safety. Then on Tuesday a new group of whistleblowers came forward to complain. Here\u2019s handsome podcaster Kevin Roose in the New York Times: The members say OpenAI, which started as a nonprofit research lab and burst into public view with the 2022 release of ChatGPT, is putting a priority on profits and growth as it tries to build artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., the industry term for a computer program capable of doing anything a human can. They also claim that OpenAI has used hardball tactics to prevent workers from voicing their concerns about the technology, including restrictive nondisparagement agreements that departing employees were asked to sign. \u201cOpenAI is really excited about building A.G.I., and they are recklessly racing to be the first there,\u201d said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former researcher in OpenAI\u2019s governance division and one of the group\u2019s organizers. Anyone looking for jaw-dropping allegations from the whistleblowers will likely leave disappointed. Kokotajlo\u2019s sole specific complaint in the article is that \u201csome employees believed\u201d Microsoft had released a new version of GPT-4 in Bing without proper testing; Microsoft denies that this happened. But the accompanying letter offers one possible explanation for why the charges feel so thin: employees are forbidden from saying more by various agreements they signed as a condition of working at the company. (The company has said it is removing some of the more onerous language from its agreements, after Vox reported on them last month.) \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest A.I. systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk,\u201d an OpenAI spokeswoman told the Times. \u201cWe agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology, and we\u2019ll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.\u201d The company also created a whistleblower hotline for employees to anonymously voice their concerns. So how should we think about this letter? I imagine that it will be a Rorschach test for whoever reads it, and what they see will depend on what they think of the AI safety movement in general. For those who believe that AI poses existential risk, I imagine this letter will provide welcome evidence that at least some employees inside the big AI makers are taking those risks seriously. And for those who don\u2019t, I imagine it will provide more ammunition for the argument that the AI doomers are once again warning about dire outcomes without providing any compelling evidence for their beliefs. As a journalist, I find myself naturally sympathetic to people inside companies who warn about problems that haven\u2019t happened yet. Journalism often serves a similar purpose, and every once in a while, it can help prevent those problems from occurring. (This can often make the reporter look foolish, since they spent all that time warning about a scenario that never unfolded, but that\u2019s a subject for another day.) At the same time, there\u2019s no doubt that the AI safety argument has begun to feel a bit tedious over the past year, when the harms caused by large language models have been funnier than they have been terrifying. Last week, when OpenAI put out the first account of how its products are being used in covert influence operations, there simply wasn\u2019t much there to report. We\u2019ve seen plenty of problematic misuse of AI, particularly deepfakes in elections and in schools. (And of women in general.) And yet people who sign letters like the one released today fail to connect high-level hand-wringing about their companies to the products and policy decisions that their companies make. Instead, they speak through opaque open letters that have surprisingly little to say about what safe development might actually look like in practice. For a more complete view of the problem, I preferred another (and much longer) piece of writing that came out Tuesday. Leopold Aschenbrenner, who worked on OpenAI\u2019s superalignment team and was reportedly fired for leaking in April, published a 165-page paper today laying out a path from GPT-4 to superintelligence, the dangers it poses, and the challenge of aligning that intelligence with human intentions. We\u2019ve heard a lot of this before, and the hypotheses remain as untestable (for now) as they always have. But I find it difficult to read the paper and not come away believing that AI companies ought to prioritize alignment research, and that current and former employees ought to be able to talk about the risks they are seeing. \u201cNavigating these perils will require good people bringing a level of seriousness to the table that has not yet been offered,\u201d Aschenbrenner concludes. \u201cAs the acceleration intensifies, I only expect the discourse to get more shrill. But my greatest hope is that there will be those who feel the weight of what is coming, and take it as a solemn call to duty.\u201d And if those who feel the weight of what is coming work for an AI company, it seems important that they be able to talk about what they\u2019re seeing now, and in the open.

          "content": "Eleven current and former OpenAI employees, along with two from Google DeepMind, released an open letter expressing their inability to voice concerns about AI risks due to confidentiality agreements. This situation reflects a recurring pattern in tech companies like Meta and Google, where idealistic employees initially tasked with building safeguards see their efforts sidelined as commercial interests take precedence. Over time, these employees may speak out, often leading to team disbandment and vague corporate reassurances.\n\nOpenAI, originally a nonprofit focused on safe AI development, transformed dramatically after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, becoming a for-profit entity valued at $90 billion. This shift, driven by CEO Sam Altman, caused internal tensions, culminating in his brief firing and subsequent return, largely due to employee threats to resign.\n\nRecent whistleblowers, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, have raised concerns that OpenAI prioritizes profits over safety, citing restrictive agreements that limit employees' ability to express concerns. The letter highlights a lack of specific allegations, attributed to these agreements, but emphasizes the urgency of addressing AI risks. OpenAI has stated its commitment to safety and has created a whistleblower hotline for anonymous reporting. The discourse around AI safety has become increasingly complex, with calls for more transparency and protections for whistleblowers, as employees seek to raise awareness about potential dangers in AI development.",

          "raw_content": "On Tuesday, a group of former OpenAI and Google DeepMind employees published an open letter calling for AI companies to commit to principles allowing employees to raise concerns about AI risks without fear of retaliation. The letter, titled \"A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence,\" has so far been signed by 13 individuals, including some who chose to remain anonymous due to concerns about potential repercussions. The signatories argue that while AI has the potential to deliver benefits to humanity, it also poses serious risks that include \"further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction.\" They also assert that AI companies possess substantial non-public information about their systems' capabilities, limitations, and risk levels, but currently have only weak obligations to share this information with governments and none with civil society. Non-anonymous signatories to the letter include former OpenAI employees Jacob Hilton, Daniel Kokotajlo, William Saunders, Carroll Wainwright, and Daniel Ziegler, as well as former Google DeepMind employees Ramana Kumar and Neel Nanda. The group calls upon AI companies to commit to four key principles: not enforcing agreements that prohibit criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, facilitating an anonymous process for employees to raise concerns, supporting a culture of open criticism, and not retaliating against employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed. In May, a Vox article by Kelsey Piper raised concerns about OpenAI's use of restrictive non-disclosure agreements for departing employees, which threatened to revoke vested equity if former employees criticized the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to the allegations, stating that the company had never clawed back vested equity and would not do so if employees declined to sign the separation agreement or non-disparagement clause. But critics remained unsatisfied, and OpenAI soon did a public about-face on the issue, saying it would remove the non-disparagement clause and equity clawback provisions from its separation agreements, acknowledging that such terms were inappropriate and contrary to the company's stated values of transparency and accountability. That move from OpenAI is likely what made the current open letter possible. Dr. Margaret Mitchell, an AI ethics researcher at Hugging Face who was fired from Google in 2021 after raising concerns about diversity and censorship within the company, spoke with Ars Technica about the challenges faced by whistleblowers in the tech industry. \"Theoretically, you cannot be legally retaliated against for whistleblowing. In practice, it seems that you can,\" Mitchell stated. \"Laws support the goals of large companies at the expense of workers. They are not in workers' favor.\" Mitchell highlighted the psychological toll of pursuing justice against a large corporation, saying, \"You essentially have to give up your career and your psychological health to pursue justice against an organization that, by virtue of being a company, does not have feelings and does have the resources to destroy you.\" She added, \"Remember that it is incumbent upon you, the fired person, to make the case that you were retaliated against\u2014a single person, with no source of income after being fired\u2014against a trillion-dollar corporation with an army of lawyers who specialize in harming workers in exactly this way.\" The open letter has garnered support from distinguished AI experts, including Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton (who has warned about AI in the past), and Stuart J. Russell. It's worth noting that other experts like Meta's Yann LeCun have taken issue with claims that AI poses an existential risk to humanity, and other experts feel like the \"AI takeover\" talking point is a distraction from current AI harms like bias and dangerous hallucinations. Even with the disagreement over what precise harms may come from AI, Mitchell feels the concerns raised by the letter underscore the urgent need for greater transparency, oversight, and protection for employees who speak out about potential risks: \"While I appreciate and agree with this letter,\" she says, \"there needs to be significant changes in the laws that disproportionately support unjust practices from large corporations at the expense of workers doing the right thing.\"",

The letter highlights a lack of effective government oversight and the broad confidentiality agreements that prevent employees from voicing their concerns, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (June 4). In the letter, titled \u201cA Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence,\u201d the employees express worry about the lack of effective oversight of leading AI companies, stating that these corporations have strong financial incentives to avoid proper scrutiny, according to the report. They argue that while ordinary whistleblower protections focus on illegal activities, many of the risks associated with AI technologies are not yet regulated, the report said. This gap leaves employees as one of the few groups capable of holding these companies accountable to the public. The letter highlights the issue of broad confidentiality agreements that prevent employees from voicing their concerns, per the report. OpenAI has faced controversy recently regarding its approach to safeguarding AI, including dissolving one of its safety teams and experiencing a series of staff departures, according to the report. OpenAI employees have raised concerns about non-disparagement agreements tied to their equity in the company, potentially limiting their ability to speak out against the AI startup. OpenAI has since announced that it will release past employees from these agreements, the report said. In their letter, the employees propose several measures to address their concerns, per the report. They call for AI companies to prohibit non-disparagement agreements related to risk-related concerns and to establish a verifiably anonymous process for staff to raise issues with the company\u2019s boards and regulators. The employees also urge companies to refrain from retaliating against current and former employees who publicly share information about risks after exhausting internal processes.",

    "background_text": "The [Crimean Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Bridge) crosses the [Kerch Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerch_Strait) between the Crimean peninsula and the Russian mainland. The bridge is [approximately 12 miles long](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland) and consists of a separated four-lane road bridge and a two-track rail bridge.

      "### Step 1: Core Factual Points\n<facts>\n1. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked three times since the Russian invasion of Ukraine: October 2022, July 2023, and a failed attempt in August 2023.\n2. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence (HUR) plans to disable the bridge in the first half of 2024, with a strategy approved by President Zelenskiy.\n3. Reports suggest an attack could coincide with Putin's May 7, 2024, inauguration.\n4. Ukraine has intensified drone attacks on Russian territory, including oil refineries and ports.\n5. Russia has strengthened defenses around the bridge, including anti-aircraft measures.\n6. Ukraine has received long-range ATACMS missiles from the U.S., which can hit targets up to 300 kilometers away.\n7. Traffic on the Kerch Bridge was temporarily halted on April 30, 2024, due to fears of a Ukrainian strike.\n8. Previous attacks on the bridge have caused significant damage, complicating Russian logistics.\n9. Ukrainian officials believe that Western weaponry could expedite the bridge's destruction.\n10. Russia has intercepted some Ukrainian missile and drone attacks, indicating robust defensive capabilities.\n</facts>\n\n### Step 2: Reasons Why the Answer Might Be No\n<no>\n1. **Strengthened Defenses (8/10)**: Russia has bolstered its defenses around the bridge, including anti-aircraft measures, making it harder for Ukraine to successfully attack.\n2. **Interception Capabilities (7/10)**: Russia has demonstrated the ability to intercept Ukrainian missiles and drones, as seen in the recent downing of six ATACMS missiles.\n3. **Symbolic Timing (6/10)**: While an attack around Putin's inauguration is symbolically significant, it also means Russia will be on high alert, reducing the likelihood of a successful strike.\n4. **Logistical Challenges (5/10)**: Coordinating a successful attack on a well-defended target like the Crimean Bridge involves significant logistical challenges and risks.\n5. **International Pressure (4/10)**: Western allies may pressure Ukraine to avoid escalating the conflict further, especially around significant political events like Putin's inauguration.\n</no>\n\n### Step 3: Reasons Why the Answer Might Be Yes\n<yes>\n1. **Ukrainian Intent and Capability (8/10)**: Ukraine's Defense Intelligence has explicitly stated plans to disable the bridge in the first half of 2024, indicating strong intent and preparation.\n2. **Recent Intensification of Attacks (7/10)**: Ukraine has increased its drone and missile attacks on Russian territory, showing a willingness to strike high-value targets.\n3. **Symbolic Timing (6/10)**: An attack around Putin's inauguration would be symbolically powerful and could boost Ukrainian morale and international support.\n4. **Western Weaponry (6/10)**: The acquisition of long-range ATACMS missiles from the U.S. enhances Ukraine's capability to strike the bridge.\n5. **Previous Successes (5/10)**: Ukraine has successfully damaged the bridge in the past, demonstrating that it is a feasible target despite Russian defenses.\n</yes>\n\n### Step 4: Aggregate Considerations\n<thinking>\nThe competing factors involve Ukraine's strong intent and enhanced capabilities versus Russia's bolstered defenses and interception capabilities. Ukraine's explicit plans and recent intensification of attacks suggest a high likelihood of attempting another strike. However, Russia's strengthened defenses and ability to intercept attacks present significant obstacles. The symbolic timing around Putin's inauguration adds complexity, as it could both motivate Ukraine and heighten Russian vigilance. The historical success of Ukrainian attacks on the bridge indicates feasibility, but the increased defensive measures by Russia cannot be overlooked.\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 5: Caution Against Bias\n<cautious>\nMedia reports may exaggerate the likelihood of an attack due to the dramatic and symbolic nature of such events. The sources may also have biases, either from Ukrainian officials emphasizing their capabilities or Russian sources downplaying vulnerabilities. The heightened attention around Putin's inauguration could lead to overestimating the probability of an attack due to the symbolic significance rather than practical considerations. Additionally, the effectiveness of Russian defenses and interception capabilities might be underreported or underestimated in Western media.\n</cautious>\n<tentative>0.55</tentative>\n\n### Step 6: Reflection and Sanity Checks\n<thinking>\nGiven the historical frequency of attacks on the Crimean Bridge and the current geopolitical context, a probability of 0.55 seems reasonable but slightly high. The base rate of successful attacks on the bridge (2 out of 3 attempts) suggests a moderate likelihood, but the increased defenses and interception capabilities should temper this. Considering the cautious analysis, a slight downward adjustment is warranted to account for potential overestimation of Ukraine's ability to overcome enhanced Russian defenses.\n</thinking>\n\n### Final Prediction\n<answer>*0.50*</answer>"

          "raw_content": "They have become a familiar sight in the skies above parts of Russia: long-range enemy drones, buzzing their way to another target. In the biggest Ukrainian onslaught inside Russian territory since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion two years ago, Ukraine has in recent weeks carried out a series of attacks on Russian oil refineries and ports. On Tuesday, it hit a refinery and drone factory in the industrial region of Tatarstan - more than 800 miles from the border. The Ukrainian spy agency behind these drone strikes has its eyes on another target: the 12-mile long Kerch bridge connecting occupied Crimea with Russia. Senior officials from Ukraine\u2019s HUR military intelligence service indicate it is plotting a third attempt on the bridge, after two previous attempts to blow it up, claiming its destruction is \u201cinevitable\u201d. For Putin, the bridge is a tangible reminder of what he sees as one of his greatest political achievements: the peninsula\u2019s 2014 \u201creturn\u201d to Russia using undercover Russian troops and a sham referendum. For Kyiv, the bridge is equally a hated symbol of the Kremlin\u2019s illegal annexation. Its destruction would strengthen Ukraine\u2019s campaign to liberate Crimea and raise morale on and off the battlefield, where Kyiv\u2019s forces are gradually being pushed back. How any Ukrainian attack would unfold is unclear and there are serious doubts about whether the HUR is capable of pulling off a special operation against such a well-defended and obvious target. Russia has taken extensive measures to protect the bridge, strengthening anti-aircraft defences and deploying a \u201ctarget barge\u201d as a decoy for incoming guided missiles. The HUR thinks it can disable the bridge soon. \u201cWe will do it in the first half of 2024,\u201d one official told the Guardian, adding that Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the main directorate of intelligence, already had \u201cmost of the means to carry out this goal\u201d. He was following a plan approved by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to \u201cminimise\u201d Russia\u2019s naval presence in the Black Sea. Over the past five months Ukraine has sunk seven landing boats and large ships belonging to Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The latest, the Sergei Kotov, capsized in March after a night-time raid involving 10 Ukrainian Magura V5 amphibious drones packed with explosives as it was on patrol south of the Kerch bridge. HUR officials indicated this was a \u201cshaping operation\u201d prior to another attack on the crossing. The bridge has been hit and repaired twice before. A 3am raid by Ukrainian sea drones last July caused extensive damage to the road section, which runs parallel to a separate railway section used by Russia\u2019s military to move tanks and supplies. In October 2022 an explosion, Russia said from a bomb smuggled on to a truck, caused several spans of roadway to fall into the water. If the bridge were permanently compromised, Moscow would be forced to transport military supplies by road through occupied southern Ukraine. The route would go via Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, which Russia partly captured in spring 2022. Ukrainian officials believe this would significantly impair the Kremlin\u2019s ability to carry out offensives at a time when its ground forces are advancing. The officials indicated that western weapons would allow Ukraine to destroy the bridge more speedily and Zelenskiy has repeatedly asked Berlin for its long-range Taurus missile system. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has so far refused, arguing that this would be tantamount to his country taking a direct role in the war with Russia, and a dangerous escalation. Pro-Kremlin Russian channels last month released an intercepted phone call in which high-ranking German military officials discussed the capabilities of Taurus. The experts estimated that 10 to 20 missiles would probably be enough to destroy the bridge. Budanov\u2019s deputy, Maj Gen Vadym Skybytskyi, said he believed European politicians were wrong to fear escalation. \u201cWhat does escalation mean for us? We have had two years of war. It\u2019s an everyday procedure,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia bombs our territory. It hits power stations and civilian infrastructure.\u201d He said victory was currently impossible on the battlefield, given Russia\u2019s military superiority and a shortage on the Ukrainian side of artillery shells and fighter jets, and suggested Kyiv had \u201cno choice\u201d but to take the fight to targets deep behind enemy lines, including military infrastructure, command and control centres and industrial production sites that made \u201cweapons and munitions\u201d. Kyiv used a Nato-standard procedure known as centre of gravity or Cog, he added \u2013 a model where outsized results can be achieved by selecting and then eliminating a few carefully picked high-value targets. In recent months the HUR has sought to wipe out Russia\u2019s refining capacity. Its long-range drones have hit Russian oil terminals in Putin\u2019s home city of St Petersburg, more than 1,000km (621 miles) from Ukraine\u2019s border. There have been attacks in the Oryol region, a blast on a train in the Urals city of Nizhny Tagil, and a strike in the Baltic port of Ust-Luga. The Tuapse oil refinery on the Black Sea also caught fire. The Financial Times reported that Washington had urged Kyiv to halt drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure for fear of driving up global oil prices. During Russia\u2019s elections last month there were explosions at fuel facilities in the Oryol and Nizhny Novgorod regions, and in the border region of Belgorod, where pro-Ukrainian Russian fighters using armoured vehicles carried out several separate border incursions. One drone was shot down near Moscow, its mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Ukraine planned to strike more Russian targets, Skybytskyi claimed, with undercover agents playing a part. Some were \u201cRussians with Ukrainian roots\u201d; others were non-ideological Russians recruited in exchange for payments. The \u201cpool\u201d was so large the HUR could pick and choose candidates for sabotage operations, he said. But Russia\u2019s own spy agencies were now back after a period on the back foot, the general added. They had adapted their techniques, he suggested. After Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion, western governments, including the UK, expelled large numbers of career Russian intelligence officers stationed abroad under diplomatic cover. There was apparent proof of the Kremlin\u2019s renewed confidence in February when a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine was found murdered in a Spanish seaside resort. Brigadier-general Dmytro Timkov, the HUR\u2019s top security official, said Maksim Kuzminov had been warned not to leave Ukraine for the EU. He ignored the advice, Timkov said. Timkov compared Ukraine to a patient on life support, in desperate need of further assistance. \u201cWe are attached to a drip. We have enough drugs to stay alive. But if the west wants us to win we need the full treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we fall down.\u201d",

          "raw_content": "Summary The bombing and shelling of populated cities, towns, and villages produces horrific humanitarian consequences. In recent armed conflicts\u2014in Gaza, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, and elsewhere\u2014this use of explosive weapons has killed and injured thousands of civilians and caused foreseeable long-term harm. In November 2022, 83 countries endorsed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas (the Declaration). The Declaration sets standards for preventing and remediating the effects generated by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. There has been growing awareness and concern about the damage and destruction that armed conflict inflicts on cultural heritage. Such heritage ranges from ancient archaeological sites to modern exemplars of architecture, world-renowned monuments to regional museums, places of religious worship to centers for artistic performance. Cultural heritage passes from one generation to another and is of global and local significance. Harm to cultural heritage is, therefore, inseparable from harm to the civilian population. This report examines the connections between the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and damage to and destruction of cultural heritage. It aims to increase awareness of the specific impacts of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and, by extension, civilians. It also offers recommendations for using the recently endorsed Declaration to better protect cultural heritage. While this report focuses on the Declaration as a tool to enhance safeguards within populated areas, cultural heritage should receive comparable protection from explosive weapons wherever it is found. When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery and mortar projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian objects at the time of attack. These weapons also have long-term indirect, or \u201creverberating,\u201d effects. They disrupt civilian infrastructure, which interferes with basic services, infringing on human rights to standard of living, health, and education, among others. In addition, they inflict psychological harm, displace communities, and cause damage to the environment and the subject of this report: cultural heritage. Chapter I of this report provides an overview of the 2022 Declaration and the concept of cultural heritage. The Declaration is dedicated to protecting civilians from the effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. It explicitly enumerates among its list of effects the \u201cdamage and destruction of \u2026 cultural heritage sites\u201d and associated \u201ccivilian suffering.\u201d While this report draws on the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, it adopts a more current definition of \u201ccultural heritage,\u201d which takes into account, for example, heritage of local significance as well as universal value. The effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage warrant attention because cultural heritage protection can help communities recover, preserve intergenerational connections, and save sites of existential meaning to civilians. Chapter II examines how the use of explosive weapons in populated areas endangers cultural heritage. It presents Russia\u2019s ongoing war against Ukraine as a case study. The chapter surveys five examples of attacks on and harm to cultural heritage in Ukraine, including to local museums and archives, cultural sites in urban centers, and places of worship. The case study highlights the frequency, diversity, and gravity of the effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and why these effects matter to the civilian population. The war in Ukraine is just one of several ongoing armed conflicts where cultural heritage has been at grave risk, including from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. In March 2024, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that, since the hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups following the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, the United Nations agency has verified 41 incidents of damage and destruction of cultural heritage in Gaza. The extensive use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas by Israeli forces is evidently the primary cause of this damage. For example, through analysis of satellite imagery, the research group Forensic Architecture found that airstrikes by Israeli forces destroyed the ancient port of Anthedon Harbour, which is on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Because the hostilities began after the bulk of research for this report had been conducted, this report does not include in-depth analysis of this cultural heritage damage, although some incidents are discussed in Chapter III. Drawing on examples from recent armed conflicts in different parts of the world, Chapter III applies the Declaration\u2019s framework of effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas to the cultural heritage context. The chapter describes the direct and indirect effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage. It also shows how such damage and destruction aggravate civilian suffering by directly causing civilian casualties and indirectly inflicting psychosocial, economic, and other types of harm. Chapter IV sets forth how states should interpret and implement the Declaration to enhance protections for cultural heritage. Specifically, it identifies five categories of actions that states should take in this area: preventive steps, data collection and sharing, remedial measures, an inclusive approach, and review and promotion of the Declaration. The chapter analyzes provisions of the Declaration that fall in each of these categories and offers recommendations for applying them in a way that maximizes cultural heritage protection. Finally, Chapter V discusses how the Declaration can bolster current means for safeguarding cultural heritage from armed conflict. The Declaration commits endorsing states to strengthen compliance with and implementation of existing international humanitarian law, which encompasses treaties addressing cultural heritage. More important, it encourages them to go beyond existing law to protect civilians and civilian objects, including through the protection of cultural heritage. This chapter lays out four areas in which the Declaration, if interpreted and implemented as this report recommends, can strengthen and clarify current law to better prevent and remediate cultural heritage-related harm. Recommendations To address the harm to cultural heritage and associated harm to civilians, Human Rights Watch and the International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC) at Harvard Law School call on states to do more to safeguard cultural heritage from the use of explosive weapons. In particular, states should: Endorse, if they have not done so already, the 2022 Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas; Interpret and implement the Declaration to enhance protections for cultural heritage; and Raise awareness of and condemn the foreseeable harm to cultural heritage and, by extension, civilians arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. I. Explosive Weapons and Cultural Heritage This chapter introduces the humanitarian consequences stemming from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and the Declaration that seeks to recognize and respond to this foreseeable and devastating pattern of civilian harm. It also offers a definition of cultural heritage and highlights the importance of its protection, even in the context of other harm to civilians and civilian objects. Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas and the Political Declaration In 2022, 83 countries endorsed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas. As of February 2024, two more states\u2014Jordan and North Macedonia\u2014had joined them. While non-binding, the Declaration if comprehensively implemented has the potential to become a valuable humanitarian tool that provides protection for civilians beyond existing international humanitarian law. When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery and mortar projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian structures at the time of attack. According to one monitoring group, in 2023, as in most years it has reported on since 2011, about 90 percent of the people who are killed or injured when explosive weapons are used in towns and cities are civilians. These weapons also have long-term indirect. or \u201creverberating,\u201d effects. They damage civilian infrastructure, which in turn interferes with basic services such as health care and education, infringing on human rights. They also inflict psychological harm, displace communities, and cause damage to the environment and to the subject of this report\u2014cultural heritage. The harm they cause is exacerbated when the weapons have wide area effects because they have a large blast or fragmentation radius, are inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at once. The International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW) was co-founded in 2011 by Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental organizations to raise awareness of and urge states to address these foreseeable and well-documented humanitarian consequences. In October 2019, representatives of 130 states gathered in Austria for the Vienna Conference on Protecting Civilians in Urban Warfare. Ireland subsequently convened several rounds of consultations to develop a shared understanding of the problem and to produce commitments to address it. The final text of the Declaration was agreed upon in Geneva in June 2022 and formally adopted in Dublin on November 18, 2022. The Declaration is the product of close collaboration among states; United Nations agencies, particularly the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); international organizations, notably the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); and civil society organizations coordinated by INEW. The Declaration aims to advance the protection of civilians from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.[7] Its preamble recognizes the practice\u2019s \u201cdevastating impact on civilians and civilian objects.\u201d The Declaration\u2019s operative paragraphs enumerate commitments to reduce that impact, including through national policies and practices, data collection, victim assistance, and humanitarian access. The introduction, or \u201cchapeau,\u201d to the operative section articulates the document\u2019s overarching purpose and notes that the Declaration commits states to \u201cstrengthening compliance with and improving the implementation of applicable international humanitarian law.\u201d It also makes clear that the Declaration, while non-binding, goes beyond existing international law by committing endorsing states to taking additional steps to advance humanitarian ends. Elaborating on the goals expressed in the Declaration\u2019s title, the chapeau specifically highlights \u201cstrengthening the protection of civilians\u201d and \u201caddressing the humanitarian consequences arising from armed conflict.\u201d These commitments thus refer to the prevention and remediation of harm from explosive weapons in populated areas. The links between explosive weapons and cultural heritage have not been explored in depth, but the connection is clear, and the evidence of harm is strong. The Declaration explicitly enumerates among its list of effects the \u201cdamage and destruction of \u2026 cultural heritage sites\u201d and associated \u201ccivilian suffering.\u201d That harm encompasses physical damage to cultural heritage sites as well as multiple reverberating effects on local communities and humanity as a whole. Consistent with the civilian protection goals of the Declaration and as discussed further in Chapter IV, it is therefore critical to interpret and implement the instrument in a way that improves protection for cultural heritage from the adverse effects of explosive weapons. What is Cultural Heritage? There are different legal definitions of \u201ccultural heritage,\u201d and experts in art history, archaeology, and other related fields have elaborated on the concept. The Declaration does not define what it refers to as \u201ccultural heritage sites,\u201d but states can look to these sources when interpreting and implementing the Declaration in a way that maximizes cultural heritage protection. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict provides a definition of the related term \u201ccultural property,\u201d which is often used in the armed conflict context. Article 1 outlines the following three categories of cultural property: (a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people\u2026; (b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a)\u2026; (c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a)and (b), to be known as \u201ccenters containing monuments.\u201d The definition, which also gives examples of each category, encompasses a broad range of cultural property, including immovable structures (e.g., \u201cmonuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular\u201d); movable objects (e.g., paintings and other works of art, books, manuscripts, etc.); and buildings that house the latter (e.g., museums, archives, and libraries). The definition also establishes a threshold of significance for something to amount to cultural property by stipulating that it must be \u201cof great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.\u201d The Hague Convention\u2019s approach offers the benefits of breadth of",

          "raw_content": "The Ukrainian armed forces have reportedly launched an assault on Russian outposts located on the Crimean Peninsula. According to Ukrainian sources, a dozen ATACMS missiles, supplied by the United States, were deployed against three air defense units of Russia last night. 24/7 BulgarianMilitary.com \u2013 all you need to know about Ukrainian \u2013 Russian war An air defense unit of the Southern Military District, from the Russian Ministry of Defense, located in the village of Donskoe, Simferopol Region, fell victim to the missile attack. This led to an ensuing fire within the military unit\u2019s premises. The assault also targeted Russian military sites, specifically those belonging to the 31st Air Defense Division in the Black Sea and Saki region, with similar missile strikes. In an official response, Russian authorities confirmed the assault. According to their report, they intercepted six of the ATACMS missiles. Along with these missiles, they also claim to have shot down ten Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles and a pair of \u2018Hammer\u2019 guided air bombs, made in France. Reports circulated by pro-Russian bloggers suggest that the missile assault might have originated overnight from Kherson, a region in southern Ukraine. Reports reveal that there have been no aggressive actions by the Ukrainian military forces towards the Kerch Bridge, an essential link between mainland Russia and Crimea. On the contrary, sources have noted that traffic on the bridge was temporarily halted earlier today due to fears of a potential Ukrainian attack. \u201cVehicular movement on the Crimean bridge has been temporarily obstructed,\u201d stated a Telegram channel that regularly provides updates on the status of the Kerch Strait bridge at 1:25 a.m. local time. Nonetheless, normal traffic flow has since resumed. The Kerch Strait Bridge acts as a primary supply route for Russian troops. Prior aggressions on the extensive 19-kilometer [nearly 12-mile] road and rail bridge by Ukraine were documented in October 2022 and again in July 2023. The bridge\u2019s undeniable role in facilitating Moscow\u2019s military activity in southern Ukraine is evident. In their pursuit to reclaim the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, Kyiv has hinted about possible future attacks on this vital structure. Vladimir Rogov, the chairman of a noteworthy pro-Russian group called \u2018We Are Together With Russia\u2019, reported this evening\u2019s activities. He communicated, \u201cThe Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 fighters initiated a missile attack on the Republic of Crimea this evening.\u201d He continued, elucidating, \u201cIn response, Russian air defenses were mobilized over Dzhankoy and Simferopol. Preliminary information suggests our defenders have performed commendably.\u201d According to updates shared by the SHOT Telegram channel, a Russian outlet reputable for its timely military updates, there have been reports of explosions resonating from the city of Simferopol in Crimea and Dzhankoy, which is known to be home to a military airport operated by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Russia promised a response Recent developments from the Kremlin suggest that if the US decides to equip Kyiv with the advanced ATACMS long-range guided missile systems, Russia may respond by pushing Ukrainian forces further back, thus extending the territory Russia considers as the \u201cneutral zone.\u201d This Russian sentiment gained traction following the US decision in October to supply Kyiv with an ATACMS missile variant capable of striking targets 100 miles away. Emerging reports point toward Congress approving a bill to assemble a new package possibly containing an extended-range missile with a striking radius of up to 186 miles. Last Monday, Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, confirmed Kyiv\u2019s receipt of these long-range ATACMS missiles, expressing his gratitude toward Washington. MGM-140B The updated version of the ATACMS missile system, the MGM-140B, is a spectacular example of innovative engineering. It has been deftly designed to deliver payloads over an impressively extended distance of up to 300 kilometers, signifying a notable leap forward in the evolution of the system. In terms of physical dimensions, the MGM-140B exudes a sense of compact neatness, stretching only about 4 meters, with a modest diameter of about 610 millimeters. However, this seemingly small size conceals a formidable powerhouse in long-range operations. Constructed with resilient, yet lightweight materials, the missile combines an array of composites and alloys. These robust materials ensure that the missile can withstand the rigorous conditions of the launch process and the inevitable stresses of flight. When it comes to operational reach, the MGM-140B truly shines, boasting an awe-inspiring capability of hitting targets up to 300 kilometers away. This extraordinary range is attributed to a robust solid propellant rocket motor, supplying the necessary thrust to propel the missile over these remarkable distances. MGM-140B\u2019s key role According to insights from specialists at the Institute for the Study of War [ISW] in Washington, UK military intelligence, and informed commentators within Russia, the tides of war could be turning due to Ukraine\u2019s recent procurement of American ATACMS long-range missiles. Intriguingly, these exceptional weapons have made their presence known, reportedly targeting the Berdyansk and Luhansk airfields as of October 17. In the preceding year, rumors were rife suggesting the liberation of Kherson from Russian military control could largely be attributed to Ukraine acquiring American medium-range GMLRS missiles. Deployed from the HIMARS platforms, these missiles were instrumental in the obliteration of Chernobayevka airport near Kherson, which had fallen into enemy hands. The mention of this airport stirs up humor and memes even to this day, following last year\u2019s fall events. It serves as an ominous reminder and metaphor in the wake of the October 17 assaults for various military-centric Telegram channels loyal to the Kremlin, including the respected Rybar channel with its alleged Russian connections. Experts reason that Ukraine\u2019s recent acquisition of long-range missiles could have profound effects that extend beyond simply war zones. One plausible scenario forecasts Russia finding it necessary to move their aircraft, helicopters, ammunition storage, and command centers a significant distance away from the frontlines. This strategic shift could afford the Ukrainian army precious extra time, slow down the response of Russian forces, and disrupt their ammunition resupply routes. This strategic edge could potentially mark a turning point for the Ukrainian army. 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine On February 21, 2022, Russia stated that its border facility was attacked by Ukrainian forces, resulting in the deaths of five Ukrainian fighters. However, Ukraine quickly dismissed these allegations, labeling them as \u2018false flags\u2019. In a notable move on the same day, Russia announced it officially recognized the self-proclaimed areas of DPR and LPR. Interestingly, according to Russian President Putin, this recognition covered all the Ukrainian regions. Following this declaration, Putin sent a battalion of Russia\u2019s military forces, tanks included, into these areas. Fast forward to February 24, 2022, global headlines were dominated by a significant incident. Putin commanded a forceful military assault on Ukraine. Led by Russia\u2019s impressive Armed Forces positioned at the Ukrainian border, this assault wasn\u2019t spontaneous but a premeditated action. Despite the circumstances resembling a war, the Russian government refrains from using this term. They\u2019d rather refer to it as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. ***",

          "raw_content": "Russian president Vladimir Putin said Monday that the deadly attack on a Moscow concert venue was carried out by radical Islamist actors, but he continued his earlier attempts to pin it on Ukraine. He cast doubt on whether a branch of the Islamic State had orchestrated it, saying there were many \u201cunanswered questions,\u201d including whether the United States was covering up Kyiv\u2019s role in the assault. Ukraine strongly denied any involvement in the Friday assault. \u201cWe know that the crime was committed by radical Islamists,\u201d Putin said in a televised government meeting on Monday evening. \u201cWe also know that the U.S. via various channels tries to persuade their satellites and other countries that, according to their intel, there is allegedly no Kyiv trace in the Moscow terrorist attack and that it was carried out by members of ISIS.\u201d Advertisement He added: \u201cWe know whose hands had committed this atrocity against Russia and its people. We are interested in those who ordered it. We need to get answers to many questions, like are radical and terrorist-linked Islamist organizations really interested in striking Russia, which stands for a fair solution to the exacerbated conflict in the Middle East?\u201d Putin then implied that Ukraine, having failed at last year\u2019s counteroffensive in the war against Russia, could \u201cbenefit\u201d from carrying out an \u201cact of intimidation\u201d against Russia. He suggested the terrorist attack would \u201clogically fit\u201d with Ukrainian military shelling of Russian border regions and striking the Crimean Bridge, which connects mainland Russia with the Crimean Peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. \u201cThis wrongdoing can only be a link in the chain of attempts of those who since 2014 have been fighting with our country through the hands of the Kyiv neo-Nazi regime,\u201d he said. Advertisement Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky angrily rejected Russia\u2019s earlier accusations that Ukraine prepared a getaway corridor at the Russian-Ukrainian border, calling it an attempt by Putin to shift the blame to Ukraine while treating his own people as \u201cexpendables.\u201d In the same government meeting Monday, the head of Russia\u2019s investigative committee said the death toll of the attack on the Crocus City Hall had risen to 139. Earlier on Monday, a Moscow court arraigned three more suspects in the terrorist attack. Investigators said the suspects helped the four men who carried out the assault on Friday by providing transportation. The four suspects arrested over the weekend appeared in court late Sunday showing signs of torture and severe abuse \u2014 confirming videos and photographs that had surfaced after their arrest suggesting brutal treatment at the hands of Russian authorities. Advertisement A barrage of videos had emerged of Russian security agents torturing the suspects \u2014 including forcing one to chew on a piece of his own ear that had been cut off, while another was stripped half-naked and subjected to electric shocks with wires attached to his genitals. The videos, which appeared on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels, were geolocated by Russian media to the time and place of the arrests in the western Bryansk region. Russian authorities identified the four suspects as migrant workers from Tajikistan, which borders Afghanistan. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday. U.S. officials say they believe, more specifically, that the Afghanistan and Pakistan arm of the terrorist group known as ISIS-K was responsible for the attack. Skip to end of carousel Moscow concert attack A deadly attack on a Moscow concert venue has killed at least 137 people, the worst terrorist attack to hit Russia in 20 years. Four men have been charged in the assault, which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for. End of carousel Putin conferred over the weekend with the leaders of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Syria, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan \u2014 an apparent nod to the Islamic State\u2019s claim of responsibility even as Putin and Kremlin-controlled media have pointed fingers at Ukraine. Advertisement Putin said Saturday that the suspects were apprehended while trying to escape to Ukraine, and Russian state media have suggested that the West is fabricating the claim of Islamic State culpability to protect Kyiv. Russian authorities have provided no evidence linking Ukraine to the attack, and Zelensky has denied any role in it and accused Putin of trying to \u201cshift the blame\u201d for his own security failures. The video and photo evidence of torture were only part of the clear thirst for revenge. In the days since the attack, several senior Russian officials have called for reinstating the death penalty, fueling fears among opposition figures that the Kremlin and security services will use the attack to toughen repression even further. \u201cThey were caught. Well done to everyone who helped catch them. Should they be killed?\u201d asked former president Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council. \u201cThey should and they will be,\u201d Medvedev wrote on his Telegram account on Monday. Advertisement \u201cBut it is much more important to kill everyone involved. Everyone,\u201d Medvedev added. \u201cWho paid them, who sympathized with them, who helped them. Kill them all.\u201d Calls to restore capital punishment, which has been banned since 1996 after Russia signed a variety of human rights treaties and adopted a new constitution, have been made several times since the war in Ukraine began, as pro-invasion figures grew more radical and aggressive. Yet there were no signs of legislative action. That has now changed. Vladimir Vasilyev, the leader of the governing United Russia party\u2019s faction in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said the proposal to restore capital punishment would be considered. \u201cThere are a lot of questions circulating about the issue of the death penalty now. This topic will certainly be deeply, professionally and meaningfully studied,\u201d Vasilyev said in televised remarks. \u201cAnd a decision will be made that will meet the moods and expectations of our society.\u201d Boris Vishnevsky, a prominent opposition lawmaker from St. Petersburg, said Russia could not restore the death penalty without rewriting its constitution. Advertisement \u201cIf we lived in a state with the rule of law, then it would be meaningless to even treat these proposals seriously because from a constitutional point of view it is impossible to return the death penalty without adopting a new constitution,\u201d Vishnevsky said in an interview. \u201cBut because our state is not ruled by the law, and they first formulate their political will and then the law is tweaked to reflect that, I can\u2019t exclude this possibility. If the president decides to do this, I think they will find legal justification for this, as it happened before.\u201d Some Kremlin propagandists suggested that the death penalty was not sufficient. \u201cI look at these faces and again think that the death penalty is too easy,\u201d wrote Margarita Simonyan, the head of the propagandist RT network. She suggested \u201clifelong hard labor somewhere underground, without the opportunity to ever see the light, on bread and water, with a ban on conversations and with not very humane guards.\u201d Advertisement Typically, Russian security services deny reports of torture, and leaks of photo or video evidence, which occur rarely, lead to public scandals and internal investigations. But on Sunday evening, the four gunmen accused in the attack were photographed in court, severely beaten. One, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, had a large bandage over his ear. Another, Muhammadsobir Fayzov, was wheeled into the courtroom on a stretcher in a nearly unconscious state. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, declined to comment on the photos in a press briefing Monday. In a separate remark, he said the Kremlin is \u201cnot currently participating in the discussion\u201d on the death penalty. Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon telephoned Putin on Sunday and distanced himself and his nation from the suspects. \u201cTerrorists have no nationality, no homeland and no religion,\u201d Rahmon told Putin, according to a statement issued by his office. Advertisement The Kremlin, in its own readout, said: \u201cDuring the conversation, Vladimir Putin and Emomali Rahmon noted that special services and relevant departments of Russia and Tajikistan are working closely in the field of countering terrorism, and this work will be intensified.\u201d On Monday, Rahmon \u0441alled the attack \u201ca shameful and terrible event that warns each of us, especially parents, to pay even more serious attention to raising children.\u201d \u201cWe must protect teenagers and youth from the influence of such destructive and terrifying groups and movements and not allow our children to discredit the good name of the Tajik nation, the sovereign state of Tajiks and their parents,\u201d Rahmon said in a statement published on his official website. Throughout Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria, between 2015 and 2017, Putin often portrayed the Islamic State as one of Russia\u2019s main enemies, and in 2017 he proclaimed victory over the group during a visit to the Middle East. Earlier this month, Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or FSB, said it had foiled an attack that ISIS-K had been planning on a synagogue in Moscow and that it had \u201cneutralized\u201d militants in a raid in the Kaluga region, southwest of the capital. Kazakhstan later confirmed that two of its citizens were killed in the raid. A year earlier, in February 2023, the FSB said it had thwarted a planned Islamic State attack on a chemical plant in Kaluga. Central Asian migrant workers in Russia are already a marginalized community, and some officials expressed fears they may face persecution and harassment from citizens and Russian law enforcement after Friday\u2019s attack. The Foreign Ministry of Kyrgyzstan warned citizens against traveling to Russia unless absolutely necessary. \u201cCitizens staying in the territory of the Russian Federation should refrain from visiting crowded places and should carry identity documents proving their identity and the legality of their stay in Russia at all times,\u201d the ministry said. Alexander Beglov, governor of St. Petersburg, said that migrant workers\u2019 dorms will be taken \u201cunder special control\u201d as part of \u201ca new format of countering the terrorist threat.\u201d Natalia Abbakumova and Robyn Dixon contributed to this report. correction An earlier version of this article misidentified which Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Moscow attack.

          "raw_content": "Officials in Moscow and in occupied Crimea have been quick to say that the July 17 explosion that damaged the only bridge linking Russia to the Black Sea peninsula was not serious and that rail and road traffic over the bridge would be quickly restored. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin asserted that the structure's supporting pylons had not been damaged and that the bridge would be completely repaired by November 1. Nonetheless, the attack struck a key logistical route supplying Russian military forces not only on the Crimean Peninsula but across southern Ukraine, where Kyiv is carrying out a counteroffensive to claw back territory that Russia has occupied since the first weeks of its unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. \u201cThe Crimea Bridge is the main logistical link,\u201d said Pavlo Lakiychuk, a military analyst at the Kyiv-based think tank Strategy XXI. \u201cEven if the railroad bridge was, say, closed for six hours or so and shipping traffic was shut down for a similar period of time, that is a six-hour break for our troops who will have fewer shells raining down on them. That is a plus.\u201d Lakiychuk dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim on July 17 that the bridge \u201chas long not been used\u201d for military transport. \u201cThe bridge has been and remains one of the main supply arteries for supplying Russian forces across southern Ukraine, including in Crimea,\u201d he said. \u201cIncluding those who are defending themselves from the attacks of our forces in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.\u201d The bridge, he said, is used to supply heavy equipment, ammunition such as artillery shells, fuel, and other crucial, ongoing needs of Russian forces in Ukraine. \u201cDelaying [these supplies] for an hour or two or three or six or 12 is a vital matter for our troops, who are engaged in heavy fighting,\u201d Lakiychuk said. \u201cThe river of military supplies for Russia has slowed to a trickle,\u201d he concluded. Andriy Yusov, the spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR), offered a similar assessment on July 17, saying: \u201cAny logistical problems are one more complication for the occupiers that creates a potential advantage for Ukrainian defense forces.\u201d Khusnullin, the Russian deputy prime minister who was put in charge of the repair works, wrote on Telegram early on July 18 that one lane of the bridge had been reopened for vehicle traffic. Immediate Impact The damage to the bridge also had an immediate impact for civilians in Crimea. Supplies of food and other essentials via the bridge were halted at least temporarily, and Russian occupation authorities warned that it could be days before truck traffic is restored. Trucks were being diverted to ferries, which can be unpredictable due to frequent high winds on the strait. This month, before the attack, truckers were already reporting that inspections and the ferry transit took around three hours. When explosions were heard in the city of Kerch at the Crimea end of the bridge on July 9, de facto officials had to quickly calm people by reporting that the bridge was not targeted. \u201cPeople in Crimea are right to worry about the Kerch bridge because transit through Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory is not safe,\u201d Lakiychuk said. The news outlet Kerch.fm reported in June that truck drivers were refusing to travel between Russia and Crimea via the occupied parts of southern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov coast out of safety concerns and were insisting on higher pay for coping with the delays at the ferries. \u201cBecause of the hours-long waits in line for the ferry, they are demanding \u2018waiting fees,\u2019\u201d the website quoted an employee at a Crimean butcher shop as saying. \u201cDrivers either do not want to go to Crimea or they are charging double to do so.\u201d Increasingly, Crimea resembles a war zone, and the peninsula has been targeted by a mounting number of drone and other attacks in 2023. The occupation authorities have undertaken a massive program of building trenches and other fortifications. However, Ukrainian military analyst Mykhaylo Prytula, a retired army colonel, told RFE/RL that Kyiv\u2019s strategy is to isolate the peninsula as much as possible. \u201cAt some point, Crimea will simply be an island without any connection to the mainland or via the Kerch bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a Crimea without water. Without military supplies\u2026. All that will be working will be the airports and the ports. Car traffic will be closed, and people will not be able to evacuate their possessions.\u201d \u201cAt that point, the only choice will be to surrender or to flee,\u201d Prytula said. The 19-kilometer Crimea Bridge, which facilitates both automotive and rail traffic, was completed in May 2018 at a cost of some $4 billion. It was a significant prestige project intended to bolster Moscow\u2019s claim to Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region that was inaugurated by Putin in person. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast -- the second attack to do substantial damage to the bridge in 10 months -- but Ukrainian media reported that security services had deployed two maritime drones to carry out the operation. Lakiychuk said that could signal a significant technological breakthrough for Kyiv. Ukraine, he said, only began developing sea-based drones after Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion and the work has been carried out \u201cunder wartime conditions.\u201d \u201cIf this is so, the Russian side wasn\u2019t ready for the Ukrainian military\u2019s capability of using such drones so far away from its military bases,\u201d he said. Crimea Becoming A Frontline Zone? He added that such operations generate valuable information for Ukrainian intelligence services that makes future operations more likely to succeed. \u201cIntelligence will have a lot of work now,\u201d Laviychuk said. The July 17 blast followed a major explosion and fire in October 2022 that prevented the full operation of the bridge for months. Lakiychuk said the fact that bridge spans collapsed in both cases could indicate that the foundation of the structure has vulnerabilities. \u201cIf the spans are falling, that means that the supports beneath them are shifting,\u201d he said. The explosion, which Russia said killed a married couple in a car and injured their 14-year-old daughter, will likely reinforce the growing impression that Crimea is a \u201cfrontline zone,\u201d to use the formulation of Refat Chubarov, the Kyiv-based president of the Worldwide Congress of Crimean Tatars and chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, a self-governing body that Russia declared illegal after occupying the peninsula in 2014. After the October 2022 explosion on the bridge, Russia was forced to intensify security checks and other measures for traffic moving in both directions, Chubarov told RFE/RL on June 30, before the most recent blast, causing alarm and frustration for travelers. \u201cThese measures will continue as long as the bridge stands, until it is destroyed by Ukrainian rockets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that will happen soon.\u201d Written by RFE/RL\u2019s Robert Coalson based on reporting by RFE/RL\u2019s Crimea.Realities, RFE/RL\u2019s Russian Service, and Current Time.",

          "raw_content": "No damage to Crimean bridge railway track, Russia-backed official says Rail traffic across the Crimean bridge continues to operate albeit with delays after an apparent attack halted road traffic on the structure early Monday, a Moscow-backed official said. Russian state-run news agencies RIA Novosti and TASS also reported that rail traffic on the bridge is continuing to operate with delays. The nearly 12-mile bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, is the longest in Europe and carries both road and rail traffic between the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. It also serves as a vital logistical node for Moscow\u2019s military in its war against Ukraine. The bridge was hit by strikes early Monday, killing two people, according to multiple reports. A widely circulating video of significant damage to one of the bridge\u2019s road spans appears to have been captured this morning from a train passing on the parallel rail bridge. Russia-backed official blames Ukraine for \"attack\" on Crimean bridge A Moscow-appointed official in occupied Crimea on Monday blamed Ukraine for an \u201cattack\u201d on the bridge connecting the peninsula to Russia. The key bridge was hit by strikes early Monday, according to multiple reports. Two people were killed in the incident, a Russian regional governor said earlier. Cryptic message: Kyiv has not claimed direct responsibility for the alleged attack but the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) posted an opaque hint on social media that its government was behind the damage. Some context: Last October, a huge blast partially damaged the bridge, causing parts of it to collapse. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar made what appeared to be the clearest admission yet that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the October attack. A deadly incident has been reported on the key bridge linking Crimea with Russia. Here's what we know An \u201cemergency incident\u201d has been reported on the Crimean bridge, halting traffic on the only link between the annexed peninsula and Russia, a Moscow-backed official said Monday. Sergey Aksenov, the Russia-appointed head of Crimea, did not specify the nature of the incident, but multiple Telegram channels reported strikes on the bridge. CNN is unable to verify the reports. Here\u2019s what we know so far: What Russian officials say: Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia\u2019s southwestern Belgorod region, said a couple traveling by car was killed and their daughter was injured in the incident. Russia\u2019s Transport Ministry said the bridge had sustained damage to its spans \u2014 the lengths between the support piers \u2014 and is being inspected by officials. The ministry did not mention the extent of the damage. What other reports say: Two strikes were allegedly carried out on the bridge around 3 a.m. local time, damaging part of the structure, according to the Telegram channel Grey Zone, which supports the Wagner mercenary group. Explosions were heard around 3:04 a.m. and 3:20 a.m. local time, Grey Zone and popular Crimean blogger TalipoV Online Z said on Telegram. At least two people were killed and another wounded, Russian Telegram channel Baza posted. Videos posted on Telegram by Baza, Grey Zone and other Crimean news outlets appeared to show part of the bridge collapsed and a damaged vehicle. Russian state media reported Monday there has been an \u201cemergency incident\u201d that had stopped traffic. What Ukraine says: A spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence said damage to the bridge could create logistical difficulties for Russian forces, but stopped short of claiming responsibility for the incident. \u201cAs for the reasons for this [damage], we do not comment. I can only quote the chief of Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, who said \u2018the Crimean bridge is an unstable structure,\u2019\u201d spokesperson Andrii Yusov told public broadcaster Suspilne. 2022 attack: The bridge was severely damaged on October 8 last year when a fuel tanker exploded and destroyed a large section of the road. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar made what appeared to be the clearest admission yet that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the October attack. \u201c273 days ago, (we) launched the first strike on the Crimean bridge to disrupt Russian logistics.\u201d Maliar posted on Telegram on July 9, as she listed Ukrainian achievements since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion. Why the bridge matters: The nearly 12-mile structure, also known as the Kerch Bridge, is the longest in Europe and carries both road and rail traffic. It also serves as a vital logistical node for Moscow\u2019s military in its war against Ukraine. The bridge holds huge strategic and symbolic importance for Russia, which built the structure at a cost of around $3.7 billion after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. It was the physical expression of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s objective to take over Ukraine and bind it to Russia forever. Crimea\u2019s significance: Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have long stated their goal of recapturing Crimea but rarely comment directly on actions in the peninsula. \u201cWe cannot imagine Ukraine without Crimea. And while Crimea is under the Russian occupation, it means only one thing: the war is not over yet,\u201d Zelensky told CNN earlier this month. Crimean bridge damage will cause logistical problems for Russian forces, Ukrainian official says The destruction of part of the Crimean bridge could create logistical difficulties for Russian forces, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence said Monday. Spokesperson Andrii Yusov told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne that Russia has been using the bridge \u201cas a major logistics hub for moving forces and resources deep into the territory of Ukraine,\u201d and \u201cany logistical problems are additional complications for the occupiers, which create potential advantages for the Ukrainian defense forces.\u201d However, Yusov stopped short of claiming Ukrainian responsibility for the incident. Some context: The bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia was hit by two strikes early Monday, according to multiple reports. Two people were killed in the incident, a Russian regional governor said. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have long stated their goal of recapturing Crimea but rarely comment directly on actions in the peninsula. 2 killed in Crimean Bridge incident, Belgorod governor says A couple traveling by car was killed and their daughter was injured in the incident on the Crimean Bridge Monday, the governor of Russia\u2019s southwestern Belgorod region said. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said the family is from Novooskolsky district of Belgorod, which borders Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region, and he has instructed local authorities to notify their relatives. The girl has injuries of \u201cmedium severity\u201d and has been placed under medical supervision, Gladkov said. Russian Transport Ministry reports damage to Crimean bridge The Russian Ministry of Transport said Monday that the Crimean bridge has sustained damage to its spans and is currently being inspected by officials. The spans on a bridge are the lengths between the support piers. The ministry did not mention the extent of the damage to the bridge. Earlier Monday, the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea Sergey Aksenov said an \u201cemergency incident\u201d occurred on the bridge, bringing traffic to a halt. Multiple Telegram channels have reported strikes on the bridge, however there has been no official confirmation. Crimean bridge hit by 2 strikes, reports say The key Crimean bridge linking the annexed peninsula to Russia was hit by two strikes early Monday, according to multiple reports. The governor of Russia\u2019s Krasnodar, Veniamin Kondratiev, said on Telegram a crisis center has been formed to coordinate emergency services and rescue those stuck in traffic on the approach to the bridge. Two strikes were reportedly carried out on the bridge around 3 a.m. local time, damaging part of the structure, according to pro-Wagner Telegram channel Grey Zone. Explosions were heard around 3:04 a.m. and 3:20 a.m. local time, Grey Zone and Crimean blogger TalipoV Online Z said on Telegram. CNN is unable to verify the reports. CNN has reached out to the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea Sergey Aksenov. Videos posted on Telegram by Russian news outlet Baza, Grey Zone and other Crimean media appeared to show part of the bridge collapsed and a vehicle damaged. According to initial reports, at least two people were killed and another wounded, Baza posted on Telegram. Russian state media reported on Monday there has been an \u201cemergency incident\u201d that halted traffic, however there has been no official confirmation of recent strikes on the bridge. Emergency responders and law enforcement have been dispatched to the scene, Aksenov said on Monday morning. Russia-backed official Elena Elekchyan said Crimea is well supplied with fuel, food and industrial goods and that local warehouses have all necessary supplies, Oleg Kryuchkov, an adviser to Aksyenov, said on Telegram Monday. It's early morning in Crimea. Here's what you need to know A Moscow-backed official in annexed Crimea said early Monday that an \u201cemergency incident\u201d has been reported on the Crimean bridge, halting traffic on the only link between the peninsula and Russia. Sergey Aksenov, the Russia-appointed head of Crimea, did not specify the nature of the incident. Last October, a huge blast partially damaged the bridge, causing parts of it to collapse. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s deputy defense minister made what appeared to be the clearest admission yet that Ukrainian forces were responsible for the October 8 attack. Here are some other key developments surrounding Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine: Putin\u2019s remarks: Russian President Vladimir Putin painted the Ukrainian counteroffensive as \u201cunsuccessful\u201d in an interview with a pro-Kremlin journalist published Sunday. Ukraine acknowledges the campaign has been characterized by tough fighting and limited progress but insists it does not feel under pressure by Western allies to deliver quick results as it does the hard work of driving Russian forces out of its territory. On the front lines: Ukraine reported fierce battles in the east, with the two sides swapping fighting positions and Russia going on the offensive in some areas. Outside the long-contested city of Bakhmut, Ukraine\u2019s military has reported slow but steady progress. In southern Ukraine, heavy Russian attacks wounded multiple people in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions on the weekend, Ukrainian officials said. Grain deal on the brink: The crucial agreement that allows the export of grain from Ukrainian ports is set to expire Monday unless Russia agrees to an extension. The deal will end at midnight July 17 into July 18 Istanbul time (5 p.m. ET on Monday), a UN spokesperson said. The Kremlin has voiced displeasure with the pact, objecting in particular to the way international sanctions affect its own exports. Cluster bombs in focus: Putin said Ukraine using cluster munitions should be considered a \u201ccrime,\u201d and vowed to retaliate if Kyiv uses the ones recently supplied by the US. But Putin\u2019s own forces have been using the controversial weapons throughout the course of the war, according to Ukraine, the United Nations and a CNN investigation from last year. Read more about both countries\u2019 use of the controversial bombs here. US ammunition running low: The United States is running low on ammunition from its own stockpile as the country works to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia, according to US national security adviser Jake Sullivan. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, upon taking office, found that overall stocks of the NATO standard ammunition used for artillery rounds \u201cwas relatively low,\u201d Sullivan told CNN. F-16s debate: Sullivan confirmed Sunday the US will allow European countries to start training Ukrainian pilots to use F-16 fighter jets, after reports that Europe was still awaiting formal approval. The US has not yet said it will supply Kyiv with the planes, however. Two US lawmakers offered differing perspectives on whether that constitutes \u201cslow-rolling\u201d the process to Ukraine\u2019s detriment. \"Emergency incident\" on Crimean bridge, Russia-backed official says An \u201cemergency incident\u201d has been reported on the Crimean bridge, halting traffic on the only link between the annexed peninsula and Russia, a Moscow-backed official said Monday. Sergey Aksenov, the Russia-appointed head of Crimea, did not specify the nature of the emergency incident. Aksenov urged residents and those traveling to and from Crimea to choose an alternative land route. Some context: Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar made what appeared to be the clearest admission yet that Ukrainian forces were responsible for an attack last October on the bridge. The attack disrupted major transport links between Russia and Crimea, which Moscow has controlled since it seized the peninsula in 2014. It also hit Russia\u2019s military effort in Ukraine and represented a",

          "raw_content": "It was either the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr or Hall of Fame New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra (or, quite possibly, neither of them) who coined the phrase: \u201cPredictions are hard to make, especially about the future.\u201d Nonetheless, for the fifth year in a row, the staff of Future Perfect will venture its best estimations of what major news events will or won\u2019t take place in 2024. Will Donald Trump return to the White House? Will OpenAI release ChatGPT-5? Will antibiotic sales for farmed animals increase? Will inflation continue to moderate? Will Oppenheimer win Best Picture? (It would have Bohr\u2019s vote, if he were a member of the Academy and if he were alive.) But we don\u2019t just make blind predictions. In keeping with the best practices of forecasters, we attach probabilities to each of our predictions. Pay attention to the probabilities! 80 percent, or even 90 percent, does not mean we are certain an event will definitely happen. (If we were, we would say 100 percent.) Rather, it means that if we made five predictions or 10 predictions, we\u2019d expect four or nine of them to come true, respectively. And as we have every year, we\u2019ll be keeping track of how we do in 2024 and letting you know our performance. (You can check out how we did in 2023 here.) \u2014Bryan Walsh The United States Donald Trump will return to the White House (55 percent) Predicting a presidential race a year out is tough. As political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien have noted, \u201cpolls from the beginning of the election year have virtually no predictive power\u201d when it comes to calling presidential races. People still respond to the state of the economy the year the election is held and the new facts they learn about the candidates as campaigns progress. A better approach than using polling is to reference some of the forecasting models political scientists have developed for predicting elections in advance. But many of these rely on data that\u2019s only available mid-year, like presidential approval ratings or economic growth in the first half of the year. The one exception is a model from political scientist Jay DeSart, which does state-by-state predictions of outcomes based on prior voting habits of the state and the national polling average in October of the year prior to the election. I plugged October 2023\u2019s head-to-head Biden/Trump polls into the model and found that it predicts a healthy Trump victory (297 electoral votes to 241), with the median forecast seeing Biden lose Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin but hang on to Michigan. But it\u2019s a narrow advantage. The polls I relied on showed an average Trump lead of 0.2 points. A swing of less than 2 points in the polls would lead to a prediction of a Biden victory. So while I think the public\u2019s lackluster mood toward the economy and Biden\u2019s relative unpopularity put him at a disadvantage going into 2024, it\u2019ll be a nail-biter for sure. This, of course, assumes Trump will be on the ballot, and the Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s ruling disqualifying him puts that in some doubt. But I don\u2019t think much doubt; as Andrew Prokop explained for Vox, the likely outcome here is that the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump\u2019s participation in the January 6, 2021, insurrection disqualifies him from the ballot, and I cannot envision the Court ruling against Trump, both because of its partisan leanings and out of fear of Trump supporter backlash delegitimizing the Court. \u2014Dylan Matthews Republicans will recapture the Senate (85 percent) The 2024 Senate map is absolutely brutal for Democrats. They are defending 23 seats to only 11 held by Republicans, and only two of the latter (in Florida and Texas) are remotely competitive. Democrats don\u2019t stand much of a chance of regaining the seats they lost six years ago in deep-red Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota, and challenging Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) will be expensive and difficult. Florida is trending Republican, and Texas hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to statewide office in three decades. Democrats, by contrast, are without a doubt losing a seat (the one Joe Manchin is vacating in West Virginia), and the Cook Political Report lists three others as tossups: the reelection bids of Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the three-way race between independent Krysten Sinema, Democrat Ruben Gallego, and an as yet undetermined Republican in Arizona. Tester and Brown are both in states that Trump won in 2020 by wide margins, and both won very narrowly six years ago. Democrats have a 51-49 majority right now, and the loss of West Virginia will narrow that to 50-50. So for Republicans to regain control, they either need to win the presidency (letting Donald Trump\u2019s vice president break the 50-50 tie) or beat either Tester, Brown, or Gallego/Sinema. That\u2019s before considering the several seats where Democrats are narrowly favored (in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan) but could still be vulnerable. Simply put: There are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it. That makes for high odds of Republican capture. \u2014DM Democrats will recapture the House (55 percent) Republicans currently hold a margin in the House nearly as razor-thin as the Democrats\u2019 lead in the Senate. After George Santos\u2019s expulsion in December, Republicans held 221 seats, just three above the bare minimum needed for a majority. If they lose five seats in November (or four and also lose Santos\u2019s seat in the special election on February 13), they\u2019re toast. There are a few reasons to think Republicans will do slightly worse than they did in 2022, just enough to lose the House. Among the most important is a recent court ruling in New York ordering a redistricting of the state\u2019s House seats, which most observers think will favor Democrats. That offsets an effort in North Carolina to gerrymander in favor of Republicans. More importantly, House and presidential voting are becoming increasingly correlated, and that\u2019s good news for Democrats. The 2022 midterms saw 18 Republicans elected from Biden-won districts, and only five Democrats elected in Trump-won districts. Redistricting scrambles those numbers somewhat (and Santos, one of the 18, is gone), but that suggests that Democrats have more obvious pickup opportunities than Republicans do in 2024. There\u2019s still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time. But Democrats have a modest leg up at this point. \u2014DM Inflation will come in under 3 points (65 percent) In 2022, I predicted that inflation (measured by the Fed\u2019s preferred metric) would stay below 3 percent; I was very wrong, as prices continued to rise at rates we hadn\u2019t seen in decades. In 2023, I predicted inflation would stay above 3 percent; I was right, but inflation was falling rapidly by the end of the year. It looks like 2024 will actually enjoy the kind of low inflation I projected two years ago. Prices will probably rise moderately, and interest rates will remain pretty high, but the big spikes we saw a while back won\u2019t return. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s range of estimates for the year is between 2.3 and 3 percent, with the median at 2.4 percent. The Survey of Professional Forecasters, which pulls together estimates from economists at banks and other private-sector entities, finds that on average they put 23.2 percent probability on prices rising by more than 3 percent between the fourth quarter of 2023 and that of 2024. I\u2019m a little less confident than them, partly because the 2022 experience made me reduce my overall confidence in our collective ability to forecast price dynamics this far in advance. More to the point, the specific forces that drove prices high in 2022, like a semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine war, do not seem likely to repeat next year. Then again, I didn\u2019t see the Ukraine war coming, and it\u2019s possible another curveball like that (maybe a Chinese incursion into Taiwan?) could send prices soaring. \u2014DM 2023 US car crash deaths will again exceed 40,000 (60 percent) Every year since the Covid-19 pandemic, the US has faced a dismal surge in car crash deaths. In 2021, for the first time since 2007, car fatalities surpassed 40,000, likely due to how Covid permanently altered America\u2019s driving routines, among other factors. The most recent full year figures available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), from 2022, show that close to 43,000 Americans were killed by cars that year, and an early estimate for the first nine months of 2023 (January through September) shows more than 30,000 deaths over that period. I\u2019d be surprised if 2023 traffic patterns differed enough from 2022 to bring us back to the pre-pandemic baseline (and the preliminary data is consistent with that hunch), so I predict that when NHTSA releases total 2023 car death figures, they\u2019ll easily remain above 40,000. \u2014Marina Bolotnikova The world Netanyahu will be unseated as Israeli prime minister (75 percent) Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel was an unprecedented calamity for the country, and many analysts think it will finally be the end of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Though he\u2019s tried to place the blame elsewhere for the failure to protect Israelis, the people aren\u2019t buying it: Polls keep showing that voters want him out \u2014 by a wide margin. In fact, the outrage being directed against him is so intense that some will find it weird that I\u2019m only giving it 75 percent odds that he\u2019ll be unseated in 2024. But if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from my years living in and reporting on Israel, it\u2019s that you should never underestimate Bibi\u2019s canny campaigning and his ability to rise from the political ashes. We\u2019ve seen it happen before. It is conceivable that he manages to cling to power for yet another term. Still, I think if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, it\u2019s now. \u2014Sigal Samuel The world will be hotter in 2024 than it was in 2023 (80 percent) Future Perfect has repeatedly predicted that the coming year will be warmer than the previous one, giving it 80 percent odds. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, \u201cThis is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.\u201d With the continued burning of fossil fuels that cause climate change, it should come as no surprise that 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded. And 2024 will probably be even hotter, in part because of El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s temperature pattern. In fact, experts predict that 2024 may be the first year that the average global surface temperature tops 1.5 degrees Celsius above what it was in the pre-industrial period. \u2014SS Narendra Modi will remain as prime minister of India after the country\u2019s 2024 elections (85 percent) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could reasonably claim to be the most popular democratically elected leader in the world. According to Morning Consult\u2019s weekly approval ratings of more than 20 democratic leaders, Modi\u2019s net approval was a sky-high +60 among Indian voters as of late November, twice as high as the next most popular leader. And while other politicians around the world have seen their fortunes ebb and flow, Modi\u2019s popularity has barely changed since the polls first became available in August 2019. That personal popularity has translated to electoral wins, most recently in state elections in December, where Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved a sweeping victory in three heavily populated northern states. Beginning in April, hundreds of millions of Indian voters will go to the polls to pick their next government in the world\u2019s largest election. Could Modi, who has been in power since 2014, lose? It\u2019s possible \u2014 more than 20 opposition parties, including the BJP\u2019s main opponent the Congress Party, formed the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in July in an effort to present a unified opposition. But this election is easier to call than just about any other in 2024. I would be",
