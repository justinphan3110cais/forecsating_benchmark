Prime Minister Fico was urgently taken to the hospital; his [condition](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/slovakia-prime-minister-robert-fico-shot/?intcid=CNR-02-0623) remains serious but stable.\n\nJust a few hours after the attack, the Deputy Chairman of the Slovak Parliament, \u013dubo\u0161 Blaho (SMER-SD party), in an emotional speech, blamed the [\"liberal media\"](https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/nejvetsi-radikalove-vladni-koalice-obvinili-z-atentatu-na-fica-media-a-opozici_2405151955_jgr) and the political opposition for inciting the shooter.

However, so far, all governmental parties have either not responded or declined the invitation.\n\nTo date, apart from the shooter, only one individual has been charged in connection with the assassination attempt, and it was for spreading online hate.

Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft. The company already has [a perpetual license to all OpenAI IP](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51) ([short of artificial general intelligence](https://openai.com/our-structure#:~:text=the%20board%20determines%20when%20we%27ve%20attained%20AGI.%20Again%2C%20by%20AGI%20we%20mean%20a%20highly%20autonomous%20system%20that%20outperforms%20humans%20at%20most%20economically%20valuable%20work.%20Such%20a%20system%20is%20excluded%20from%20IP%20licenses%20and%20other%20commercial%20terms%20with%20Microsoft%2C%20which%20only%20apply%20to%20pre%2DAGI%20technology.)), including source code and model weights; the question was whether it would have the talent to exploit that IP if OpenAI suffered the sort of talent drain that was threatened upon Altman and Brockman\u2019s removal. Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

The process is fraught with stringent regulatory requirements, high financial costs, advanced technological needs, and often public and political scrutiny. These challenges contribute to the rarity of new nuclear projects; for instance, Vogtle Unit 3 was the first new nuclear unit constructed in the U.S. in more than 30 years.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the progress of Georgia Power Co's Vogtle Unit 4 at Plant Vogtle near Waynesboro, Ga., is significant. [This unit has reached a crucial milestone with the commencement of fuel loading, an essential step towards its start up and commercial operation](https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/vogtle-unit-4-starts-nuclear-fuel-load.html). The successful construction and operation of Vogtle Unit 4, following the recent commissioning of Unit 3, reflect Georgia Power's commitment to expanding nuclear energy. This commitment is underscored by the unit's potential to provide reliable, emissions-free energy to a significant number of homes and businesses. However, the project isn't without its challenges, including managing construction costs, scheduling, and ensuring adherence to safety and regulatory standards.",

    "question": "Will OpenAI file lawsuits against Microsoft related to the firing of Sam Altman before March 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "On November 17, 2023, OpenAI [announced that it had fired CEO Sam Altman](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired). Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft. The company already has [a perpetual license to all OpenAI IP](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51) ([short of artificial general intelligence](https://openai.com/our-structure#:~:text=the%20board%20determines%20when%20we%27ve%20attained%20AGI.%20Again%2C%20by%20AGI%20we%20mean%20a%20highly%20autonomous%20system%20that%20outperforms%20humans%20at%20most%20economically%20valuable%20work.%20Such%20a%20system%20is%20excluded%20from%20IP%20licenses%20and%20other%20commercial%20terms%20with%20Microsoft%2C%20which%20only%20apply%20to%20pre%2DAGI%20technology.)), including source code and model weights; the question was whether it would have the talent to exploit that IP if OpenAI suffered the sort of talent drain that was threatened upon Altman and Brockman\u2019s removal. Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

Beginning with prominent figures like [Karen Silkwood in 1974](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karen-Silkwood), who raised alarms about health and safety issues at a nuclear fuel plant, the trend continued with the actions of the GE Three in 1976, who exposed safety problems at nuclear power plants. These individuals, along with others like Ronald Goldstein and Arnold Gundersen, faced harsh retaliation including dismissal and harassment. Their disclosures not only brought critical safety issues to public attention but also influenced significant policy and legislative changes, demonstrating the vital role of whistle-blowers in maintaining safety standards in the nuclear sector.\n\nNote that while the background is primarily concerned with US whistleblowers the question being asked is global in scope.",

    "question": "Will a new SARS-CoV-2 variant be classified as a Variant of Concern (VOC) or worse in the United States before March 1, 2024?",
    "background_text": "The SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG), established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, coordinates between the CDC, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and Department of Defense. This group is responsible for classifying and monitoring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks [SARS-CoV-2 variants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-classifications.html) classified by the SIG. As of December 1, 2023, the CDC shows four variant classifications which describe the characteristics of certain variants for use in informing the public health response. The four classifications are described as follows:\n\n**Variants Being Monitored (VBM)**\n>. . . Variants designated as VBM include:\n>\n>* lineages with potential impact on available medical countermeasures based on analysis of genetic sequence data.\n>* lineages that previously caused more severe disease or increased transmission but that are no longer detected.\n>* lineage with an unusually large number of antigenic mutations AND presence in multiple countries with collection dates within 4 weeks.\n>*lineages previously designated as a VOI, VOC, or VOHC that are currently circulating at very low levels in the United States.\n>\n>A Variant of Interest or a Variant of Concern may be downgraded to this list after it is no longer circulating at sustained levels and no longer poses significant risk to public health in the United States. Classifications may change over time, based on the evolving situation and information available.\n\n**Variant of Interest (VOI)**\n>. . . Variants designated as VOI include variants that have:\n>\n>* reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced efficacy of FDA approved treatments, or diagnostic tests.\n>* predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.\n>\n>Possible attributes of a Variant of Interest include:\n>\n>* specific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.\n>* evidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.\n\n**Variant of Concern (VOC)**\n>. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of interest, variants designated as VOC include:\n>\n>* increase in transmissibility.\n>* more severe disease (for example, increased hospitalizations or deaths).\n>* significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\n\n**Variant of High Consequence (VOHC)**\n>A VOHC has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of concern, variants designated as VOHC include impact on MCMs such as:\n>\n>* demonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets.\n>* evidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease.\n>* significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple EUA or approved therapeutics.\n>* more severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.\n\nThe variant class hierarchy is described by the CDC as follows:\n\n>Each variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI). . . U.S. classifications may differ from the WHO classifications because the impact of variants may differ by location.\n\nAs of December 1, 2023, only \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" is classified as a VOC. All other variants are classified as VBM, except for \"variants containing the F456L spike mutations\" which is classified as a VOI. Previously the only variants to have reached the level of VOC were Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron, though all but \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" have since been downgraded.",

Since then, the Conservatives have maintained control of Parliament.  One of the key issues over the last decade was Britain's relationship with the European Union and its policies on immigration, with Conservatives ultimately paving the way for Brexit, while the Labour Party and other left-wing groups favored remaining.\n\nConservative leadership has been divided in recent years.  In spite of this apparent weakness, Labour has also lacked a key leader, and the rise of the Scottish National Party, which shares appeal with Labour (their founder was Scottish), has led to a loss of most seats from Labour to the SNP.  Some Scottish constituencies have experienced vote-splitting between Labour and the SNP, allowing Conservatives to gain seats there.\n\nCurrently, British law requires that the next general election be held [no later than January 28, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election).",

Following the announcement there were reports that OpenAI leadership and its employees were unhappy with the move, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced he was quitting.\n\nIn his article for his independent analysis publication, Stratechery, Ben Thompson wrote:\n\n>* Over the weekend rumors surged that Altman was negotiating his return, only for OpenAI to hire former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as CEO.\n>* Finally, late Sunday night, [Satya Nadella announced via tweet](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122) that Altman and Brockman, \u201ctogether with colleagues\u201d, would be joining Microsoft.\n>\n>This is, quite obviously, a phenomenal outcome for Microsoft.

Indeed they will, as a good portion of that talent seems likely to flow to Microsoft; you can make the case that Microsoft just acquired OpenAI for $0 and zero risk of an antitrust lawsuit.\n\n[According to Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/openais-board-is-no-match-for-investors-wrath/):\n\n>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major OpenAI partner, was reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d to learn of Altman\u2019s departure \u201cminutes\u201d after it happened, and has been in touch with Altman \u2014 and pledged to support him \u2014 as OpenAI backers (in particular Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital) recruit Microsoft\u2019s aid in exerting pressure on the board to reverse course. Meanwhile, some key venture capital backers of OpenAI are said to be contemplating a lawsuit against the board; none, including Khosla Ventures and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, were given advance notice of the decision to fire Altman.",

At the moment, proprietary models dominate the LLM [leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard), though given the fast-moving nature of this industry, it is unclear whether the advantage of large, proprietary models will be sustained.",

[Analyses of the data](https://elpais.com/america/2024-08-02/quien-gano-en-venezuela-los-datos-de-la-oposicion-son-mas-verificables-que-los-oficiales.html) show that the numbers correspond *exactly* to those percentages, a result consistent with the percentages being made up and the corresponding vote counts being calculated back from them.\n\nMeanwhile, civil society in the country has been performing an [independent, bottom-up verification of the results](https://resultadosconvzla.com/); reports generated immediately after the election by the voting machines in precincts around the country are digitized and posted online. Aggregation of these vote counts show a 37-point victory for Gonz\u00e1lez over Maduro.\n\nHow will the Chavista president respond? Will he publish a full, disaggregated count of the results?",

    "background_text": "While major tech companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google have actively released their Large Language Models (LLMs) to the public, Apple remains an exception in this trend. Despite its significant advancements and investments in AI, particularly with the internal development of the rumoured [Ajax-powered chatbot](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800430/apple-gpt-ai-chatbot-generative-ai), Apple has not yet made any of its generative AI technologies publicly available. This contrasts with the faster approaches of its competitors, who are rapidly deploying and releasing their LLMs for widespread use and research, showcasing a divergent strategy in the competitive field of artificial intelligence. Given Apple\u2019s large resources and track-record of strong product launches, any potential Apple LLM may be one of the strongest contenders.",
