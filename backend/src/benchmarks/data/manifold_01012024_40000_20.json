    "background_text": "Musk says the goal of the next Starship mission is to get past the point of maximum re-entry heating \"with all systems functioning\". This market considers the somewhat lower bar of \"not exploding\".  Resolves YES if in the fourth Starship\u2013SuperHeavy test flight, SpaceX confirms that Starship didn't experience a rapid unscheduled disassembly until after passing the point of maximum re-entry heating. Any RUD (of Starship) earlier in the flight causes this market to resolve NO. If telemetry is lost before the point of maximum re-entry heating, and it cannot be confirmed exactly when a RUD occurred with respect to the point of maximum heating, the market resolves NO. It only resolves YES if it can be confirmed that the vehicle survived past that point. Confirmation via other means than on-board telemetry will count (but seems unlikely). This market stays open until the fourth flight launches, meaning lifts off the pad, however slightly, under the thrust of its engines. Therefore a RUD on the pad before launch does not cause this market to resolve NO, it will stay open pending the result of the next Starship\u2013SuperHeavy flight, even if that flight is not named IFT-4. Edit May 21st: this market will close at launch so that I can recoup some subsidy at resolution. This makes subsidising markets like this more viable.",

    "background_text": "In the past, 538 has covered presidential debates by sponsoring polling of debate viewers and asking them who won. If they do this again for the first such debate in the 2024 election, this market resolves Yes if Biden wins and No if Trump wins, according to that polling.  If there are several questions polled about the candidates' debate performance, this question resolves based on the closest thing to the question \"Overall, who do you think won the debate?\" If 538 does not sponsor their own polling but does have a definitive post-debate article covering other polling, perhaps averaging different polls of debate viewers, this market will resolve based on that coverage. I will update this criteria as we learn more about the first debate and 538's coverage. Resolves N/A if there is no debate between Biden and Trump, or if 538 does not do post-debate coverage with debate viewer polling.",

    "background_text": "This resolves YES if I measure my weight at 160.0 lbs or less on May 16th 2024 ET, otherwise NO. 5'7\" and 186.4 lbs at time of posting. I will only buy YES and I will not sell my position. At time of posting (Jan 30) I weigh 186.4. My scale displays in 0.2 lbs increments. I just got a body fat caliper and measured at 30.4%BF, meaning 160 lbs would be about 19%BF. I don't know how accurate my reading was but 30% seems right, visually. I started logging my weight when I tried to do this for my last trip (Jan 2-18) but failed midway and gained most of it back. This market only resolves based on the last day so I need to keep it off.  I want to lose this weight so I can walk a lot with feet pain and not be as hot throughout the trip, so I will be very disappointed if I don't get pretty close. I mainly focus on having a large calorie deficit. I hope I will exercise but I'm not sure how consistently I'll do it. I'm cutting the embed to just this attempt, but the sheet has data back to october and I should be updating it daily. Values with yellow highlighting are interpolated. Link to Google Sheet",
