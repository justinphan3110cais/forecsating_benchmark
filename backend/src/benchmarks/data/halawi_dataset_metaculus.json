      "background_text": "From the onset of the Gaza-Israel conflict, many pro-Israeli nations have shown their support for Israel via high profile visits including, US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nUkraine is another nation which is seen as pro-Israeli, however, in past and present times, the relationship between both nations has appeared tentative. Israel still maintains friendly relations with Russia, and Israel has yet to outright condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Israel has also, until recently, refused to send military aid to Ukraine which is in stark contrast to many of Israel's western allies.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy initially indicated his intention to visit Israel in a show of support, however this was initially shot-down by Netanyahu, stating that the \"time is not right\".\nThis decision was short-lived, as it was recently reported that Zelenskyy's trip to Israel was in advanced stages of planning. Said reporting, however, was leaked (presumably by members of Netenyahu's government), and the trip was promptly cancelled:\nAccording to the diplomat, the Ukrainian president \"wanted the trip to be public when he stepped on Israeli soil.\" \"He's very disappointed,\" he added.",

      "question": "Will Delhi perform cloud seeding before December 1, 2023?",
      "background_text": "New Delhi, the capital of India, has been experiencing very poor air quality. According to data from AirNow, the majority of the month of November has been at an air quality index (AQI) level of \"Very Unhealthy\" or worse, and nearly half of the month has been at levels of \"Hazardous\".\nAccording to a November 10th Nature article:\nAs the Hindu festival of Diwali kicks off on 10 November, the Indian capital of Delhi, already blanketed in choking smog, is bracing for pollution to worsen. Over the past week, children struggling to breath the acrid air have flooded hospital emergency departments, and schools have been forced to close. . .\n\u201cEvery year it is a similar story,\u201d says Vinayak Sinha, an atmospheric chemist at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali.\nBut although Delhi\u2019s air is attracting attention now, scientists say that the spike is actually typical for this time of year. The post-monsoon season, which lasts from October to December, delivers an annual pollution bomb to Delhi, a megacity of more than 30 million people. Other cities in India are also plagued by poor air quality at this time of year.\nSinha says that atmospheric conditions after the monsoon exacerbate pollution. Rainfall that washes pollutants out of the air during the monsoon ceases. As temperatures fall, the upper boundary of the troposphere \u2014 the lowest layer of atmosphere \u2014 drops in altitude and the troposphere shrinks. That causes the soup of pollutants in the troposphere to become more concentrated, says Sinha. \u201cYou have a smaller container now into which your air emissions are being stored,\u201d he says.\nEven so, current conditions came as something of a surprise, says Karthik Ganesan, a policy researcher at the Council on Energy Environment and Water in New Delhi. That\u2019s because the amount of crop waste burnt in the neighbouring Punjab region was lower than usual this year, causing some people to expect a milder increase in pollution.\nBut as it turned out, air quality was as poor as ever because of changing meteorological conditions, including drops in wind speed on certain days. When wind speed falls, the air stagnates, trapping local emissions and leading to a pollution spike, says Ganesan.\nNew Delhi is reportedly considering new approaches to improve the air quality, such as cloud seeding. According to Wired:\nIndia\u2019s capital, New Delhi, is preparing a new weapon in the fight against deadly air pollution: cloud seeding. The experiment, which could take place as early as next week, would introduce chemicals like silver iodide into a cloudy sky to create rain and, it\u2019s hoped, wash away the fine particulate matter hovering over one of the world\u2019s largest cities.\nThe need is desperate. Delhi has already tried traffic restriction measures, multimillion-dollar air filtration towers, and the use of fleets of water-spraying trucks to dissolve the particulate matter in the air\u2014but to no avail.\n. . .\nNow, Delhi officials are seeking permission from federal agencies in India to try cloud seeding. The technique involves flying an aircraft to spray clouds with salts like silver or potassium iodide or solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, to induce precipitation. The chemical molecules attach to moisture already in the clouds to form bigger droplets that then fall as rain. China has used artificial rain to tackle air pollution in the past\u2014but for cloud seeding to work properly, you need significant cloud cover with reasonable moisture content, which Delhi generally lacks during the winter. If weather conditions are favorable, scientists leading the project at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur plan to carry out cloud seeding around November 20.",

The alert quotes an article published by FTV News, a publication by the Taiwanese broadcasting company Formosa Television.\nProMED quoted the machine translated article as follows:\nWith the outbreak of pneumonia in China, children's hospitals in Beijing, Liaoning and other places were overwhelmed with sick children, and schools and classes were on the verge of suspension. Parents questioned whether the authorities were covering up the epidemic.\nIn the early morning, Beijing Children's Hospital was still overcrowded with parents and children whose children had pneumonia and came to seek treatment. Mr. [W], a Beijing citizen: \"Many, many are hospitalized. They don't cough and have no symptoms. They just have a high temperature (fever) and many develop pulmonary nodules.\"\nThe situation in Liaoning Province is also serious. The lobby of Dalian Children's Hospital is full of sick children receiving intravenous drips. There are also queues of patients at the traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and the central hospitals. A staff member of Dalian Central Hospital said: \"Patients have to wait in line for 2 hours, and we are all in the emergency department and there are no general outpatient clinics.\"\nSome school classes have even been canceled completely. Not only are all students sick, but teachers are also infected with pneumonia. ...\nMr. [W], a Beijing citizen: \"Now you are not allowed to report to school. If you have any symptoms such as fever, cold, cough and then you are hospitalized, you can ask for leave...\"\nSince China stopped adhering to the \"zero\" policy at the beginning of the year [2023], epidemics such as influenza, mycoplasma, and bronchopneumonia have broken out from time to time. ...\nA novel pathogen is generally considered to be one which has not previously been found to infect humans.",

Penn President Liz Magill stepped down after receiving backlash for her responses during the hearing.\nClaudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth remain presidents of their respective universities, and on December 12th the Harvard board unanimously expressed their support for Gay. However, Gay has also faced accusations of plagiarism during the increased scrutiny, and on December 13th the US House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning antisemitism that included a call for Gay and Kornbluth to step down.

      "question": "Will NASA re-establish communications with Voyager 1 before 1 Jan 2024?",
      "background_text": "The Voyager probes are the human-made machines that have gone both the fastest and the furthest away from Earth. They were launched in the late '70s,\nInitially designed to last five years, the Voyager probes are the two longest-operating spacecraft in history. Their exceptionally long lifespans mean that both spacecraft have provided additional insights about our solar system and beyond after achieving their preliminary goals of flying by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune decades ago.\nHowever, their continued operation relies on creative ways to shut down instruments to conserve power, and it's not always smooth sailing:\nAlong the way, both spacecraft have encountered unexpected issues and dropouts, including a seven-month period in 2020 when Voyager 2 couldn\u2019t communicate with Earth. In August, the mission team used a long-shot \u201cshout\u201d technique to restore communications with Voyager 2 after a command inadvertently oriented the spacecraft\u2019s antenna in the wrong direction.\nUnfortunately, now\nVoyager 1\u2019s flight data system now appears to be stuck on auto-repeat. The mission team first noticed the issue November 14, when the flight data system\u2019s telecommunications unit began sending back a repeating pattern of ones and zeroes, like it was trapped in a loop.\nA fix is unlikely to to implemented before the new year.\nIt could take several weeks for engineers to develop a new plan to remedy the issue. Finding solutions to challenges the probes encounter often entails consulting original, decades-old documents written by engineers who didn\u2019t anticipate the issues that are arising today. As a result, it takes time for the team to understand how a new command will affect the spacecraft\u2019s operations in order to avoid unintended consequences.\nThis question answers how unlikely, exactly?",

Trump's legal team has appealed this decision to the US court of appeals, pausing proceedings in the district court, however the trial is scheduled to begin March 4, 2024, and an appeal might delay the proceedings.\nThe petition asks the Supreme Court to decide on the immunity issue promptly so that the trial can proceed as scheduled. The Supreme Court has responded to the petition with a motion to expedite consideration of the petition and directing Trump to file a response to the petition by December 20th.",
