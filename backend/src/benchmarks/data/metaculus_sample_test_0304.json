Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's Prime Minister [has called](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67332811) its access to the sea an \"existential question\".

    "question": "Will a Chinese firm market an ArFi photolithography machine before 2025?",
    "background_text": "In October 2022, the US instituted [new, wide-ranging export controls](https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai) aimed at controlling a set of \u201cchokepoint\u201d technologies in the global semiconductor supply chain. China is one of the leading countries in AI, but AI advancements have historically run on compute, and China\u2019s access to cost-competitive machine learning (ML) compute \u2014 the Chinese AI industry currently relies in large part on AI chips designed and fabricated abroad, and in particular Nvidia GPUs \u2014 is now in question.\n\nThe [US export controls](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C) prevent the export of high-performance AI chips to China, as well as the export of advanced tooling and materials used to make such chips. Still, one way for China to gain better access to cost-competitive ML compute is to indigenously produce high-quality AI chips. In 2015, China set out an ambitious plan aiming to bring the proportion of chips bought by Chinese firms that is domestically produced from 15% to 70% by 2025; as of 2021 [that number had gone up to 24%](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/U.S.-tech-curbs-threaten-China-s-quest-for-chip-independence). With the October restrictions \u2014 and with US allies like Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands enacting their own controls \u2014 Chinese firms now face substantial challenges in their attempts to indigenize semiconductor production.\n\nSome of the most important inputs into the chip-making process is semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) \u2013 highly complex and specialized tools essential to the chip-making process. (Other important inputs include specialized materials, software, and more generally capital, talent, and know-how.) Many of these tools \u2014 including most tools necessary for producing the most advanced chips \u2014 are prohibited from being exported to China.\n\nIn particular, the most important type of SME is photolithography machines, which are some of the most complex machinery ever made by humans. These machines expose a photomask (which holds the pattern that needs to be etched onto the silicon wafer) to light; the patterned light then reaches a photoresist material on the wafer. The exposed parts of the photoresist dissolve or harden, and the remaining parts can be removed to yield a mask for the next deposition or etching steps that form the chip\u2019s circuits. The photolithography industry is dominated by the Dutch company ASML.\n\nChina\u2019s major [photolithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography) maker is Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), founded in the early 2000s. SMEE [markets](http://www.smee.com.cn/eis.pub?service=homepageService&method=indexinfo&onclicknodeno=1_4_4_1) krypton fluoride (KrF) and argon fluoride (ArF) dry steppers for mature process nodes, but these either aren\u2019t ready for mass production and/or are far behind (>15 years) Dutch and Japanese KrF and ArF machines in terms of resolution, throughput, and quality. SMEE does not market any more advanced argon fluoride immersion (ArFi) machines, though it is [reportedly](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinese-lithography-firm-to-debut-28nm-capable-scanner-report) \u201con track to reveal its first scanner capable of producing chips on a 28nm process technology by the end of 2023\u201d.\n\nFor more information, I have written a primer on [indigenously made Chinese AI chips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-aLT67d2OQnuhZJZihkr0KxxB-PsDMKMut2flaYQ2c/edit?usp=sharing), intended to provide a useful introduction and reference for anyone interested in forecasting or learning more about China\u2019s ability to indigenously produce AI chips. It explains some key concepts, provides an overview of the chip-making process, provides an overview of relevant export controls, and describes key inputs, context, and organizations relevant to understanding Chinese chip-making progress.",

Kennedy is [described as](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-picks-rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-activist-health-human-services-secreta-rcna180182) an anti-vaccine activist by NBC News, which said:\n\n>In a [post on X](https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1857198805919138235), Kennedy said, \"We have a generational opportunity to bring together the greatest minds in science, medicine, industry, and government to put an end to the chronic disease epidemic.\"\n\n>During his presidential campaign, Kennedy developed a national profile for his criticism of the Covid vaccines and childhood immunizations. He has claimed that [vaccines are tied to autism](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470), despite evidence conveyed through studies over decades that have disproven such a claim.\n\nKennedy potentially faces an uphill battle for his Senate confirmation. A few Republican senators have [expressed concerns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/20/rfk-senators-vaccines-abortion-agriculture/) about Kennedy's vaccine skepticism. Additionally, some Republicans have criticized Kennedy's pro-choice sentiments, with former Vice President Mike Pence [saying](https://x.com/McCormackJohn/status/1857441573572632706), \"If confirmed, RFK, Jr. would be the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.\" \n\nHistorically, although no nominees for HHS Secretary have been voted down by the US Senate, in 2009 Tom Daschle, Barack Obama's nominee for HHS Secretary, withdrew his nomination when information surfaced about unpaid taxes by Daschle.

    "background_text": "Since the beginning of its [ground operations in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip) in October 2023, Israel has repeatedly issued evacuation warnings for regions of Gaza, advising residents in those regions to move to designated humanitarian areas. According to a [BBC article published in May of 2024](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c299pl8j8w7o):\n\n> More than three-quarters of Gaza's territory have been designated as evacuation zones by the Israeli military since the war against Hamas began in October, an analysis by BBC Arabic has found.\n> \u00a0\n> The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued evacuation orders to Gazans since Israel launched a military campaign on 7 October in response to a cross-border attack that day by Hamas, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 people were taken hostage. The Israeli response has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n> \u00a0\n> The BBC\u2019s analysis shows the cumulative areas designated as evacuation zones amount to 281 sq km (108 sq miles). That is the equivalent of 77% of Gaza's territory.\n\nInitially focusing its ground operation on northern Gaza, Israel later expanded the operation to southern Gaza, and was [reported to have retreated from northern Gaza in July 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/12/middleeast/israeli-military-withdrawal-central-northern-gaza-palestinians-killed-intl/index.html). However, in October 2024, Israel [resumed operations in northern Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/12/middleeast/israel-military-push-northern-gaza-intl/index.html).\n\nThe conflict in Gaza and the resulting evacuations have [caused international concern about displaced Palestinians](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/14/hopeless-starving-and-besieged/israels-forced-displacement-palestinians-gaza). Concerns were elevated in early November 2024, when it was reported that Palestinians may not be allowed back to northern Gaza. [According to CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-offensive-beit-lahiya-idf-says-civilians-not-allowed-back/):\n\n> Briefing journalists Tuesday night, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, who commands the IDF's 162nd Division operating in Gaza, said that since troops had been forced to enter some areas twice, including the Jabaliya camp, \"there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes.\"\n\nHowever, [The Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/idf-israel-military-no-return-remarks-north-gaza) that the IDF distanced itself from that statement and that the comments had been taken out of context.\n\nThe IDF normally announces evacuation zones and humanitarian areas through its representatives, for example through [Avichay Adraee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avichay_Adraee), Head of the Arab Media Division of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. For example, see Adraee's posts on X from [October 8, 2024](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1843647422829879299) and [October 12, 2024](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1844966449091100695/photo/1), stating areas which must be evacuated corresponding to the IDF's resumed push into northern Gaza. The posts include images depicting blocks within Gaza, corresponding to a [map of numbered blocks released by the IDF](https://www.idf.il/ar/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A/swordsofiron-011223-150/) (note, if the map is showing only blue you may need to zoom out, or alternatively open it in a private browsing window without location access).\n\nThe IDF has [stated that it is not forcibly displacing Palestinians](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/20/israel-northern-gaza-ultimatum-palestinians), saying in a [November 2024 letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25351674-response-letter-minister-dermer-and-minister-katz/):\n\n> Israel affirms that it had no and has no policy of forced evacuation of civilians from anywhere in the Gaza Strip, including northern Gaza. At no point has Israel issued \"Evacuation Orders\" anywhere in the Gaza Strip throughout the war. Rather, Israel warns the civilians population in a certain area, prior to operating in that area, in accordance with the Laws of Armed Conflict, and urges them to distance themselves from areas of intense hostilities.\n> \u00a0\n> No civilian is forced to leave, and the population that chooses to remain in these areas is taken into consideration in the operational planning, including the facilitation of humanitarian assistance.\n\nWhether and when Palestinian civilians will be able to safely return to northern Gaza remains an open question. In April 2024 it was reported that thousands of Palestinians attempted to return to northern Gaza, but [CNN reported that the IDF stated](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/palestinians-return-northern-gaza-intl-latam/index.html):\n\n> The northern Gaza Strip continues to be an active war zone and return to the area is not currently permitted.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

    "background_text": "In 2020, the Future of Life Institute published a report entitled [\"The Windfall Clause: Distributing the Benefits of AI for the Common Good.\"](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Windfall-Clause-Report.pdf) (They also wrote [an abridged version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11595) to be published in the [Proceedings of AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375627.3375842). Also, fun aside: Metaculus' own [@Anthony](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/8/) got a shout-out in the acknowledgements.) Essentially, they expanded on an idea from Bostrom's Superintelligence that a firm working on transformational AI technology could limit global inequality as a result of their breakthrough by pre-committing to keep only a fraction of the fabulous profits, and distribute the rest.\n\nThough there are numerous obstacles barring the path to making this plan a reality, the FLI research lowers many of these bars, including investigating the legal apparatus for enacting such an agreement and envisioning some of the logistical means by which a windfall might be distributed. What really remains is buy-in. If this plan will work, it will work because the companies positioned to develop windfall AI technologies signed on to a Windfall agreement in advance.",

    "question": "Will Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the general ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?",
    "background_text": "The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has a section known as the \"Disqualification Clause\" or Section 3, which may disqualify individuals from holding federal or state office if they have \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [U.S.], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" Given the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, this section has become a subject of considerable debate with respect to former President Donald Trump's eligibility to run for federal office again.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Bryant \"Corky\" Messner, an attorney who ran for U.S. Senate in 2020 with Trump's endorsement, has [expressed intentions to file a legal challenge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2023/08/29/trump-14th-amendment-new-hampshire-gop-feuds-as-states-grapple-with-disqualifying-trump-from-ballot/?sh=70038b512e9a) questioning Trump's 2024 candidacy under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The Republican Secretary of State of New Hampshire, David Scanlan, while not actively seeking to remove any candidates, has stated that he will seek legal advice on the issue. Additionally, Michigan\u2019s Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has indicated that she will seek a legal opinion on this matter. Voters have also filed lawsuits in Florida and Michigan on the issue. Legal battles are widely expected, and these disputes might reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThis question focuses on whether these and similar ongoing discussions and legal challenges will result in Donald Trump being removed from the general election ballot of any state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by November 5, 2024, the date of the presidential election.\n\n**Note: This question focuses on removal from a general election ballot.

Ted Cruz stated on his podcast in [January 2022](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/04/ted-cruz-joe-biden-impeachment/):\n\n>Democrats weaponized impeachment [...] they used it for partisan purposes to go after Trump because they disagreed with him. And one of the real disadvantages of doing that \u2026 is the more you weaponize it and turn it into a partisan cudgel, you know, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nThroughout his term, Biden has maintained that his plan is to run for re-election, as confirmed by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in [June 2022](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1536477522988343296).",

    "question": "Will the US unemployment rate exceed 5% before 2025?",
    "background_text": "As of August 2024, bond markets are signaling increasing concerns about a potential US recession, driven by [weaker-than-expected economic data](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm), particularly a disappointing July jobs report. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up in July, raising fears that the labor market, which had been a pillar of economic strength, may be starting to crack under the pressure of high interest rates.\n\nHistorically, the unemployment rate has been a key indicator of the health of the US economy and labor market. During recessions, the unemployment rate typically rises significantly as businesses lay off workers and hiring slows. For example, during the brief but severe recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the unemployment rate spiked to 14.8% in April 2020 before gradually declining as the economy recovered.\nAs of July 2024, the US unemployment rate stands at [4.3%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE). \n\nThis question asks whether the unemployment rate will exceed 5% before 2025, a threshold that would signal a significant deterioration in labor market conditions and likely coincide with a broader economic downturn.",

    "question": "Will the EPA grant a waiver for the entirety of California's proposed Advanced Clean Cars II before January 21, 2025?",
    "background_text": "The [Clean Air Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)ss) (CAA) is the broad name given to the United States' air quality laws, which are administered by the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) (EPA). Originally passed in 1963, the CAA has been [amended numerous times](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/evolution-clean-air-act). The CAA prevents states from imposing their own emissions regulations for new vehicles, with an exception that states [which had imposed vehicle emissions regulations prior to March 30, 1966](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL30853) may apply for a waiver to enforce their own emissions regulations contingent on the regulations being more stringent than the national regulations, along with several other conditions.\n\nAs the only state meeting the date requirement, California is uniquely positioned to adopts its own emissions regulations. Additionally, the [CAA permits other states](https://www.epa.gov/state-and-local-transportation/vehicle-emissions-california-waivers-and-authorizations#:~:text=subpart%20B%2C%20%C2%A7%201074.105.-,State%20Adoption%20of%20California%20Standards,-The%20Clean%20Air) to adopt, without federal review, emissions regulations imposed by California which have been granted a waiver by the EPA.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board (CARB) [says the following](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/california-waiver-facts) about the history of its waiver applications (emphasis theirs):\n\n>**No waiver has ever been revoked and the one previous denial was quickly reversed.** There is no Clean Air Act process for revoking a waiver \u2013 which makes sense because governments and industry rely on waivers for years after they are granted to deliver clean vehicles and develop clean air plans. Even waiver denial is incredibly rare. The one time this occurred, in 2008, the U.S. EPA initially denied California\u2019s waiver for GHG emission standards for 2009 and later model year light-duty motor vehicles. That denial was reversed when the U.S. EPA reconsidered it, and ultimately granted it.\n\nDetails about prior waivers are available at [this EPA page](https://www.epa.gov/state-and-local-transportation/vehicle-emissions-california-waivers-and-authorizations).",

    "question": "Will there be a serious radiation incident at any nuclear plant in Ukraine before 2025?",
    "background_text": "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_and_incidents):\n\n> \"A nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as \"an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility. Examples include lethal effect to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, reactor core melt.\" The prime example of a \"major nuclear accident\" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\n\nThe situation regarding Russian control of Ukrainian nuclear reactors, particularly the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), has been a [focal point of concern](https://www.world-nuclear.org/ukraine-information/ukraine-russia-war-and-nuclear-energy.aspx) since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The ZNPP, Europe's largest nuclear plant with six reactors, has been under Russian occupation since the early stages of the invasion in February 2022. The plant came under armed attack in March 2022, marking the first instance of an operating civil nuclear power plant being attacked during an active conflict. This attack led to a projectile hitting a training building and resulted in a fire, but essential equipment and the reactors remained unaffected\u200b\u200b.\n\nSince the conflict began, the [operation of the reactors has varied](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197574725/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-power-plants), with some being taken offline or put online as needed, depending on the stability of external power supplies and conditions around the plants\u200b\u200b.\n\n> There are six reactors at Zaporizhzhia maintained by Energoatom personnel, according to Kotin, but Russia controls the plant. Those reactors are currently offline. Meanwhile, Ukraine is operating nine reactors generating electricity at three other locations around the country.\n\nIn June 2023, Russia and Ukraine accused each other of [plotting to stage an attack on ZNPP](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-accuse-each-other-plotting-imminent-attack-nuclear-station-2023-07-04/).",

    "question": "Will the current European Commission propose a European Union directive or regulation banning all types of caged-housing for egg-laying hens before October 31, 2024?",
    "background_text": "*This question has been posed by [Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/), a non-profit research organisation, as part of their work on European Union animal welfare policies.*\n\nEuropean Union (EU) legislation currently allows the use of \"enriched\" cages for egg-laying hens as well as alternative cage-free systems through [Directive 1999/74/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1999/74/oj). EU statistics indicate that [50.5%](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/eggs-dashboard_en.pdf) of egg-laying hens in the EU are cage-free.\n\nIn July 2020, the European Commission [tasked](https://www.ciwf.eu/news/2020/07/eu-agency-to-look-at-welfare-of-animals-in-caged-systems?utm_campaign%3DECI%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dciwf) the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) with investigating the welfare of cages for laying hens to provide a sound scientific basis by December 2022 for 'future legislative decisions'. The EFSA website specifically [mentions](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/animal-welfare?utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Defsa%26utm_campaign%3Danimalwelfare2%26utm_content%3Dcorporate) the \"[End the Cage Age](https://www.endthecageage.eu/)\" [European Citizens\u2019 Initiative](https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/home_en) signed by over 1 million European Union citizens calling for a ban on using confined housing in livestock farming, which includes the caging of laying hens, in the whole EU. In September 2020, the Commission put out a call for 24 month tenders for the pilot project \"[Best Practices for Alternative Egg Production](https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=7175)\". In August 2020, in response to parliamentary questions, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides [reiterated](https://www.topagrar.com/management-und-politik/news/tierwohl-ist-wesentlicher-bestandteil-der-farm-to-fork-strategie-12332974.html?utm_source%3Dtopagrar) that the EU Commission would present a working paper on the implementation of animal welfare in the European Union in early 2022 and will present appropriate legislative proposals by the end of 2023.\n\n[Directives](https://europa.eu/european-union/law/legal-acts_en#directives) are a type of EU law that define goals that have to be incorporated into the national law of countries in the EU within a certain time period but allow some flexibility for countries to apply rules to achieve these goals, and to set stricter standards if they wish. [Regulations](https://europa.eu/european-union/law/legal-acts_en#regulations) are binding rules with immediate direct effect in member states and therefore are much stronger instruments but do not allow flexibility to accommodate different legal systems across the 27 EU countries. As the only institution in the EU that can formally initiate legislation, it is up to the European Commission to launch a directive or regulation. Proposals move back and forth through the other institutions of the EU for amendments and votes and may eventually be passed into law. A number of EU members have announced their own national restrictions on caging hens that go beyond existing EU requirements.\n\n*   Germany [announced](https://www.bmel.de/EN/topics/animals/farm-animals/laying-hen-husbandry-q-and-a.html) a phase-out deadline for existing cage holdings by the end of 2025, with an extension to this deadline of up to a maximum of three years (2028) only in special cases of hardship.\n*   In Austria, a [ban](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/research/species-laying-hens/laying-hens-case-study-austria/) on enriched cages comes into force in 2020.\n*   In Luxembourg, the [ban](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmenvfru/writev/egg/egg.pdf) is already in place and no cage hen farms are operating there.\n*   In September 2020, the Deputy Chamber of the Czech Parliament approved a total [ban on cages](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2020/09/victory-for-czech-hens?utm_campaign%3Dcageage%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dciwf%26fbclid%3DIwAR3jCdGH3OATBg9o3vJBmpbZ6PXrjLAR3U5z8jHJQH9crY1iGDyBDTSPPDQ) for laying hens from 2027. It has yet to be passed by the Czech Senate.\n*   The Slovak agricultural minister [announced](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2020/02/the-slovak-republic-to-end-the-cage-age) the intention to phase out cages by 2030.\n*   In the Walloon Region in Belgium, the government has adopted the [Walloon Code of Animal Welfare](https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/ambitious-animal-welfare-code-wallonia-including-ban-battery-caged-hens), under which keeping hens in enriched cages will become illegal by 2028. Flanders, the other major province in Belgium, was also due to make such a ban but it has [not happened yet](https://www.animalrights.be/ben-weyts-waar-blijft-het-verbod-op-kooieieren) (although there was some suggestion back in 2009 that a full cage ban would not come [until 2040](https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/upgrading-hen-housing-latest-developments-in-europe)).\n*   France is to [ban](https://www.poultryworld.net/Eggs/Articles/2018/2/France-to-ban-sale-of-eggs-from-caged-hens-by-2022-251161E/) the sale of whole eggs from caged hens in shops by 2022 (but not eggs broken and used as ingredients).\n*   The Netherlands plans to [ban enriched cages](https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/calling-dutch-agricultural-minister-ban-cages-laying-hens) from 2021, but allow a larger type of cage (colony cages) to continue to be used.\n\nIn September 2020, the Czech ministry of agriculture submitted a [proposal](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-10844-2020-INIT/en/pdf) for an EU-wide ban on cages for laying hens from 2030 at an EU council meeting and media [claimed](http://eagri.cz/public/web/mze/tiskovy-servis/tiskove-zpravy/x2020_ministr-zemedelstvi-jednotny-trh-by-mel.html) that \"the European Commission and some member states, e. g. Austria, France, Denmark, Sweden or Slovakia, welcomed the Czech proposal.\u201d Note that Czechia is due to take over the rotating Presidency of the European Council in July 2022 until December 2022 and Sweden will take over from January 2023 to June 2023. The Greek Minister of Rural Development and Food, Makis Voridis, [signalled](https://www.agro24.gr/agrotika/agrotiki-epikairotita/eyropaiki-enosi/yper-tis-ethelontikis-symmetohis-sta-oikologika) support for an EU ban on the use of cages for hens. Cypriot Minister for Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment, Kadis, [allegedly](https://twitter.com/Olga_CIWF/status/1310932201354256385) offered support for an EU ban. The EU Commission serves a 5 year term, and the current term is due to end on 31 October 2024.",

The administration has been careful to call their plans budget neutral in messaging, which is prompting some creative revenue gathering exercise.\n\nThe bill would create a new provision stating that digital asset \u201cbrokers\u201d would need to issue IRS forms to certain users to obtain underpaid taxes.

Will that happen?\n\n435* seats will be contested in 2024 (most in November, but some runoffs are possible). The question resolves after enough races have been called by reliable media reports to give a majority to one party or another.

    "question": "Will Donald J. Trump be convicted of at least one count in his federal court cases before the end of 2024?",
    "background_text": "Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, has been involved in an array of legal battles post his presidency. Currently facing three indictments with the prospect of a fourth, his legal circumstances have sparked curiosity about the possible outcomes.\n\n**Assessing the Odds**\n\nEstimating the odds of a jury reaching a guilty verdict in at least one of Trump's cases can be complex. Historically, federal conviction rates in the U.S have been relatively high, often surpassing 90%. However, this figure doesn't necessarily imply the same odds for Trump's case. The likelihood of a guilty verdict depends heavily on the evidence, the nature of the crimes, the lawyers involved, the jury's composition, and public opinion, among other factors.\n\n**The \"Stealth Juror\" Scenario**\n\nOne of the factors complicating the trial outcome is the possibility of a 'stealth juror'. In this context, a stealth juror refers to a passionate Trump supporter (who didn't vote in 2016 and 2020 for whatever reasons) pretending to be neutral who, despite being obliged to judge impartially, could be biased in their judgement. If at least one juror refuses to agree with the others, it could lead to a hung jury, which may complicate the process further.\n\nU.S courts use a process called voir dire to select impartial jurors. While this process is usually effective, it is not foolproof. A passionate supporter could potentially hide their bias, impacting the verdict. However, such a scenario is relatively rare and challenging to pull off. Furthermore, even if a stealth juror manages to cause a hung jury in one case, the likelihood of this happening consistently across multiple trials is low.\n\nBesides backing Trump, a juror could have other motivations for opposing a guilty verdict in a federal trial against a former president.",

Amazing details on Blaine\u2019s feat are available in this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_blaine_how_i_held_my_breath_for_17_min) \n\nAll very nice. But bioengineering will allow us to push the record up\u2014possibily, way up. Some techniques, like \u201clung packing,\u201d are already being put to use by daredevils. [Per Deadspin](https://deadspin.com/how-long-can-humans-hold-their-breath-1467541916): \n\n> This [lung packing] consists of inhaling the very largest breath possible, and then, without exhaling, puffing your cheeks full of more air and attempting to force that air down into your lungs. You are literally stretching out your lungs so that they can hold more air.\n\nMore exotic ideas, like the so-called [\u201cAquaman Crystal\u201d](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-create-crystal-which-could-allow-us-to-breathe-underwater-9772871.html) are promising.\n\nSome extreme atheletes and freedivers are no doubt experimenting and [pushing the limits](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/11/nicholas_mevoli_freediving_death_what_happens_to_people_who_practice_holding.html).\n\nAnd there are documented cases on the record of people surviving without oxygen for long periods of time. As the [BBC reports](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140714-how-long-can-you-go-without-air):\n\n> When US toddler Michelle Funk fell into an icy stream in 1986, she survived an estimated 66 minutes underwater, preserved by deep hypothermia that reduced her metabolic rate to almost nothing.\n\nFunk\u2019s case was a freak accident.

    "question": "Will Section 230, ruling no liability for false or defamatory posts from users on internet platforms,  be revoked or amended in the US by January 20, 2025?",
    "background_text": "The Communications Decency Act of 1996, and specifically [Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230), were the result of a rare display of bi-partisanship during the Bill Clinton presidency (1993-2001). The legislation was driven by the efforts of Chris Cox, Republican congressman and former White House staffer for Ronald Reagan, who joined hands with Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden in an effort to allow then-nascent Internet service providers to moderate online discussions and suppress pornography and other content.  \n\nThe next year, the Supreme Court struck down most of the anti-porn provisions on freedom-of-speech grounds, and Section 230 was left as the main consequence of the new legislation: Internet providers, whether moderating content or not, were from then on fairly safe from lawsuits regarding any of the content they publish and any decisions on which users are allowed to publish.\n\nBacklash against Section 230 grew among Republicans and the right in the 2010s, as discussion groups and influential users with hundreds of thousands of followers, such as Yiannopoulos, were banned from platforms with no recourse. Democrats and the left also expressed significant concerns from the start of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency in 2017, following accusations that Facebook \u2013 in particular \u2013 was used to spread disinformation that benefited Trump\u2019s campaign. \n\nTrump launched [an effort to terminate Section 230](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/) in May 2020. Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden was also expressing support for striking down the controversial legislation, although he later took down [Trump\u2019s executive order on the matter](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/biden-revokes-trump-executive-order-that-targeted-section-230/ar-BB1gLnW9).\n\nPolitical discussion is heating up on the issue and may heat up even further if the GOP regains control of Congress next year; Big Tech is resolutely opposed to the move \u2013 in March, Google CEO [Sundar Pichai warned Congress](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ceo-warns-of-unintended-consequences-if-congress-kills-section-230-153748127.html) of unintended consequences if Section 230 were revoked.",

    "question": "Will any two countries out of the US, UK, Germany, Canada, France, or Australia curtail diplomatic ties with Israel before 2025, citing Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza?",
    "background_text": "*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy: [Will Israel Lose International Support for Its Campaign in Gaza?](https://www.verity.news/controversy/Will-Israel-Lose-International-Support-for-its-Campaign-Against-Hamas)*\n\n---\n\nSince its establishment in 1948, Israel has seen [growing international recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign\\_relations\\_of\\_Israel), though is still not universally recognized due to the longstanding [conflict between Israel and a number of the Arab countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli\\_conflict). In particular, the [United States has been a close ally of Israel](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23916266/us-israel-support-ally-gaza-war-aid), with the US having provided [at least $158 billion](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) in bilateral assistance and missile defense funding since Israel was established.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack against Israel \u2014 which saw [nearly 1,200 people killed](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hamas\\#chapter-title-0-8) and [over 250 taken hostage](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67053011) \u2014  many friendly countries [expressed support for Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\\_reactions\\_to\\_the\\_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas\\_war). However, Israel\u2019s responding military campaign against Hamas in Gaza led a [number of countries to sever relations](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/16/israel-gaza-war-countries-against-cease-fire-diplomats) due to the humanitarian situation, which has seen nearly [40,000 Palestinians killed](https://www.ochaopt.org/) as of August 2024 according to the Gaza Ministry of Health (though this number is disputed by Israel), and close to two million Gazans displaced. The US, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Canada have supplied Israel with weapons since the beginning of the war, though Canada, Italy, and the Netherlands [halted arms sales to Israel in early 2024](https://www.reuters.com/world/who-are-israels-main-weapons-suppliers-who-has-halted-exports-2024-05-09/).\n\nBut as the war approaches one year of duration and Israel has [expanded into other regions in Gaza](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4660135-israel-moves-deeper-into-rafah/), the international mood may be shifting against Israel. In March of 2024, the US abstained on a [UN Security Council Resolution demanding a ceasefire](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/israel-gaza-us-abstention-on-un-cease-fire-vote-triggers-netanyahu-rage.html), allowing it to pass against the wishes of Israel. And in May 2024 the International Criminal Court (ICC) [sought arrest warrants](https://www.newsweek.com/israel-losing-diplomatic-war-palestine-united-nations-europe-1904064) for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Additionally, a number of countries have now granted diplomatic recognition to Palestine in response to the conflict. These actions have [caused some to argue](https://time.com/6963032/israel-netanyahu-allies-global-standing/) that the world is turning against Israel over its operation in Gaza.\n\nThe countries of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, and Australia make up a subset of the [G20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20), and are among the ten member states of the G20 that [do not recognize Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\\_recognition\\_of\\_the\\_State\\_of\\_Palestine\\#:\\~:text=while%20ten%20countries%20(Australia%2C%20Canada%2C%20France%2C%20Germany%2C%20Italy%2C%20Japan%2C%20Mexico%2C%20South%20Korea%2C%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20and%20the%20United%20States)%20have%20not).",

For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.\n\n>EPA establishes an AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act. Each of these pollutants has a national air quality standard set by EPA to protect public health:\n\n> - ground-level ozone\n> - particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10)\n> - carbon monoxide\n> - sulfur dioxide\n> - nitrogen dioxide\n\nOn November 21, 2024, CNN [reported](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/20/india/delhi-pollution-clinic-smog-climate-intl-hnk/index.html) that New Delhi had the most hazardous air for human health in the world, leading the Delhi Chief Minister to declare a \"medical emergency\" as authorities closed schools and urged people to stay home. On November 20, 2024 the reading for PM2.5, which has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive impairment in children, was more than 77 times higher than safe levels set by the WHO.\n\nAt the time of this question, in 2024 year to date 6% of hours have had an AQI classified as Hazardous,  12% of hours have been Very Unhealthy, and 33% Unhealthy.

    "question": "Will Ukraine sever the land bridge between Crimea and Russia before 2025?",
    "background_text": "In late February and March 2014, following the Euromaidan uprising and removal of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, thinly disguised Russian military and paramilitary forces seized control of the Crimean peninsula in the far South of Ukraine and of most of the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in its East, leading to a protracted conflict.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale conventional invasion of Ukraine. One of its first objectives was to seize the band of territory in Ukraine's southeast, between the Azov Sea and the Dnipro river, which connects Crimea in the south and Donetsk and Luhansk in the East.\n\nThrough the Spring and Summer of 2022, Ukraine achieved a series of counteroffensive victories and expelled Russian forces from a large area of the country. In September, Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), in his [programmatic article](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3566162-ak-zabezpeciti-voennu-kampaniu-u-2023-roci-ukrainskij-poglad.html) on Ukraine\u2019s coming campaign of 2023, called Crimea the \"*center of gravity of the enemy*\" and advised planning operations to seize it. Removing the Russian protective belt around the peninsula would be the first step towards achieving this goal. If executed simultaneously with destroying the Crimean bridge near Kerch it would cut off Crimea from supplies by land. Already in August, Arestovych, an advisor to president Zelensky, had [floated the idea]( https://www.unian.net/war/arestovich-schitaet-uspeh-v-melitopole-strategicheski-vazhnym-dlya-vsu-novosti-vtorzheniya-rossii-na-ukrainu-11935857.html) of an offensive on Melitopol, a key transportation hub on the land bridge, and opined that its success would collapse the entire Russian frontline. \n\nIn November 2022, with their supply lines in serious danger from Ukrainian artillery, the Russian occupiers fled Kherson for the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro, leaving the southeastern land bridge as the obvious next objective. Several Russian military bloggers predicted a land bridge offensive, with variations in timing, possible tactics and the exact direction of attack, e.g. [Dimitriev](https://t.me/russ_orientalist/12458), [MIG]( https://t.me/mig41/22148), [Moscow Calling]( https://t.me/m0sc0wcalling/14259), [Nesmiyan]( https://t.me/RSaponkov/3947) and [Saponkov]( https://t.me/RSaponkov/3947).\n\nOn the Ukrainian side, the [New York Times cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/world/europe/ukraine-war-strategy-russia.html) \"*hints from the troops on the ground and volunteers close to them*\" that preparations for such an offensive were in the works. Russian forces were said to be aware of the danger and [to have been reinforcing their units and fortifying their lines]( https://ria.ru/20221019/svo-1825016250.html) in the Southeast for some time.\n\nThere is some flexibility with the direction of the offensive. Ukraine can strike in the east, towards Mariupol, in the center, towards Berdyansk or Melitopol (the most discussed option), or even in the west, from the newly captured Kherson towards Henichesk. Cutting the land bridge in two could be a first step to reoccupying it entirely, leaving Russia with no more territory than it started with, and potentially bringing the war closer to its termination.\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive [began in June 2022](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/06/08/russia-ukraine-war-news-counteroffensive/), but as of December 2023, it does not appear close to severing the land bridge, and in fact there are [significant doubts about its chances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/ukraine-counteroffensive-us-planning-russia-war/) [of](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/us/politics/us-ukraine-war-strategy.html)  [success](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war-drones-stalemate/).

Despite the differences in the box office performances of the previous installments in their respective franchises, projections for both films [appear to be similarly strong](https://boxofficetheory.com/5-week-tracking-forecasts-mufasa-the-lion-king-and-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-early-box-office-ranges-plus-wicked-gladiator-ii-and-moana-2-updates/).\n\nBox Office Mojo generally [defines](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-mojo-by-imdbpro-faq/GCWTV4MQKGWRAUAP#domesticinternational) \"domestic\" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico).

Additional sources of revenue, such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, etc. are not included.\n\n>Gross refers to gross earnings in U.S. dollars. On average, a movie's distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the \"rentals\") with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e. movie theater). The money split varies from movie to movie, but, generally, the contract favors the distributor in early weeks and shifts to the exhibitor later on.\n\n>Weekend box office charts show gross receipts for a given weekend, which is Friday through Sunday unless otherwise noted. Studio estimates for the weekend are reported on Sunday mornings, generally between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific Time and reflect estimated Friday and Saturday box office receipts plus a projection for Sunday.",

Bibi herself has been involved in the graft case and on November 22, a court issued a non-bailable warrant for her arrest as she failed to appear in eight court hearings. On November 23, the police attempted to arrest her, but they were unsuccessful as she was not present at her residence.",

Several large publishing groups backed the 2019 version of the Act, such the American Society of News Editors, the National Newspaper Association, and the News Media Alliance, which includes The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. At the same time, proponents of the JCPA hope it would endow smaller, more niche, or local publishers with bargaining power and leverage they might lack individually.",

AlphaCode was assessed on challenges [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), a platform for competitive coding with prizes for the best and most efficient solutions to the problems posed. [According to the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce):\n\n>AlphaCode was tested on 10 of challenges that had been tackled by 5,000 users on the Codeforces site. On average, it ranked within the top 54.3 percent of responses, and DeepMind estimates that this gives the system a Codeforces Elo of 1238, which places it within the top 28 percent of users who have competed on the site in the last six months.\n\nIn December of 2023, DeepMind announced AlphaCode 2, powered by its [new Gemini model](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/). In an [accompanying technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode2/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf), DeepMind described AlphaCode2 as a significant improvement over the first AlphaCode and said it performed better than 85% of competition participants on Codeforces.\n\n>When evaluated on the Codeforces platform \u2013 a mainstay of competitive programming \u2013 AlphaCode 2 solves 43% of problems within 10 attempts, close to twice as many problems as the original AlphaCode (25%). While its predecessor performed at the level of the median competitor, we estimate that AlphaCode 2 reaches the 85th percentile on average.\n\nSo far AlphaCode results appear to be based on a comparison of its performance to those of contestants without actually entering the contest. [Discussions of the results](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123035) by Codeforces users correctly guessed that a user known as AdamentChicken2 was one of the accounts used to submit AlphaCode 2 solutions, which was [confirmed by the user](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123035?#comment-1091379) and in an X (formerly Twitter) posts ([1](https://twitter.com/RemiLeblond/status/1732712334626361671), [2](https://twitter.com/RemiLeblond/status/1732677521290789235)) by DeepMind research scientist R\u00e9mi Leblond.",

Hydrazine is one of the high performance monopropellants with low flame temperature, which makes it an efficient propellant. However, its toxicity to humans and environment has put, firstly, an economic burden on using such propellant during various development and operation phases. Secondly, an ethical burden toward the environment if such sense to be considered. It is worthy to note that hydrazine is not just an appealing efficient propellant for Space-use, but it is also seems to take a critical role in aeronautical military applications [such as fueling the auxiliary power units](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084802/http:/oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA065595) of the F-16 fighters and Eurofighter Typhoon.\n\nSpeaking of today in 2021/2022 and from a technical point of view, the economical as well as the environmental hazards concerns are taken seriously into account when considering \u2018space mission analysis & design.\u2019 The latter two aspects when coupled are crucial during the conceptualization of a given space mission as well as developing modern spacecraft critical components such as the propulsion systems.\n\nBasically, space industry is currently oriented toward adopting the so-called \u2018Green Propellants.\u2019 A very simple technical definition for Green Propellants can state that the propellants possessing no (or very marginal) health concerns or environmental hazards either in storage, transportation, or operation phases of a project lifecycle, are considered to be \u2018green\u2019 \u2013 this would opt out propellants with high-toxicity like hydrazine, but fossil hydrocarbons are not yet considered \u2018non-green\u2019 fuels in the framework of Space propulsion applications in contrary to fuels in automobile industry. More detailed technical definitions can be referenced in the these academic articles: [Article 1](http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-71f98242-5541-4f80-a02b-8b601f7fe31b), [Article 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/8/1/20/htm#B3-aerospace-08-00020).\n\nCurrent Green Propellants industry is reaching maturity that several global research efforts have already provided commercially available and space-tested green propellants. Examples are: the US Air Force developed propellant AF-M315E (currently known and commercialized as [ASCENT](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/green/gpim-nears-completion.html)); the European [LMP-103S](https://www.ecaps.space/hpgp-performance.php) developed by Bradford ECAPS; and the Japanese [HNP-family](https://encyclopedia.pub/7693) of green monopropellants developed by [IHI Aerospace Co., Ltd](https://www.ihi.co.jp/ia/en/products/space/pinot/pinot-g/en/index.html). These propellants are suitable for spacecraft use in in-space propulsion, usually for the [small spacecraft class](https://www.nasa.gov/smallsat-institute/sst-soa-2020). \n\nThere were rumors among the aerospace European community ([particularly since 2017](https://spacenews.com/hydrazine-ban-could-cost-europes-space-industry-billions/)) that EU would ban completely the use of hydrazine by 2021, so far nothing is clear however about this intention.",

    "question": "Will there be a US government shutdown before January 1, 2025?",
    "background_text": "In its article [Q&A: Everything You Should Know About Government Shutdowns](https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-government-shutdowns) the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget describes government shutdowns as follows:\n\n>Many federal government agencies and programs rely on annual funding appropriations passed by Congress. Every year, Congress must pass, and the President must sign budget legislation for the next fiscal year, consisting of 12 appropriations bills, one for each Appropriations subcommittee. Congress has not yet enacted any of the 12 bills for FY 2023 that make up the discretionary spending budget and has instead been funding the government through a CR that was enacted at the end of September. In a \u201cshutdown,\u201d federal agencies must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. Essential services continue to function, as do mandatory spending programs.\n\n>. . .\n\n>Since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, there have been 20 \u201cfunding gaps,\u201d including the 2018-2019 shutdown and the one in January 2018, when funds were not appropriated for at least one day. (The hours-long lapse in appropriations in February 2018, though sometimes characterized as a shutdown, did not result in federal employee furloughs.) However, before 1980, the government did not shut down but rather continued normal operations through six funding gaps. Since 1981, 10 funding gaps of three days or fewer have occurred, mostly over a weekend when government operations were only minimally affected. \n>\n>There have now been four \u201ctrue\u201d shutdowns where operations were affected for more than one business day. The first two happened in the winter of 1995-1996 when President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were unable to agree on spending levels and the government shut down twice, for a total of 26 days. The third was in 2013 when a House and Senate standoff over funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) resulted in a 16-day shutdown. The fourth shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019, technically only a partial shutdown because five of the 12 appropriations had previously been enacted, centered on a dispute over border wall funding and was the longest-lasting shutdown at 35 days.\n\nThe History, Art & Archives of the US House of Representatives [provides a list](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Shutdown/Government-Shutdowns/) of funding gaps and whether or not they included shutdowns. The US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) maintains [information about shutdown furloughs](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/#Shutdown-Furlough) as well as [shutdown contingency plans for agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/agency-contingency-plans/).",

    "background_text": "Under 3 U.S.C. \u00a715, the US Houses of Congress meet on January 6th following the election [to count the votes of the electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Act).\n\nIf there are any objections to the returns from any state, they must be resolved before the process can continue to the next state. For an objection to be considered and voted on, it must be in writing and made by at least one representative and one senator. This has happened 4 times - once each in 1969 and 2005, and twice in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the returns from [Arizona](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/01/06/sen-ted-cruz-house-gop-republicans-object-to-arizona-electoral-votes-congress) and [Pennsylvania](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/live-update/pro-trump-mob-breaches-u-s-capitol/1-senator-and-80-house-members-object-to-pennsylvania-results-triggering-further-debate) were objected to and debated - with both objections defeated - and this would not have been enough to swing the election, as their combined 31 electoral votes, if changed from Biden to Trump, would still have left Biden the victor.\n\nThis question asks if sufficiently many objections will be made to potentially influence the outcome of the election.",

    "question": "Will the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) be passed before 2025?",

Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Boozman (R-AR) officially introduced the [Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4760/text), a bill aimed at providing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies within the context of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The draft of this bill has been [leaked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1582814734587265024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582814734587265024%7Ctwgr%5E4a8506fcaf909a8b2ed867c4fcc7cac474f83c04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F112420%2Fcftc-dccpa-bill-leak-defi-regulation) in October 2022. \n\nAccording to [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2022/08/how-the-digital-commodities-consumer-protection-act-of-2022/), the central proposals of the DCCPA are:\n\n>Close regulatory gaps by requiring all digital commodity platforms (defined to mean a person that is one or more of the following: digital commodity broker, a digital commodity custodian, a digital commodity dealer, a digital commodity trading facility) to register with the CFTC\n\n>Require digital commodity platforms to prohibit abusive trading practices, eliminate or disclose conflicts of interest, maintain sufficient financial resources, have strong cybersecurity programs, protect customer assets and report suspicious transactions\n\n>Require digital commodity platforms to adhere to advertising standards and disclose information about digital commodities and their risks, bringing greater transparency and accountability to the marketplace\n\n>Authorize the CFTC to impose user fees on digital commodity platforms to fully fund its oversight of the digital commodity market\n\n>Direct the CFTC to examine racial, ethnic and gender demographics of customers participating in digital commodity markets and use that information to inform its rulemaking and provide outreach to customers and\n\n>Recognize that other financial agencies have a role in regulating digital assets that are not commodities, but function more like securities or forms of payment.\n\nThis proposed bill has been supported by several figures in the cryptocurrency industry, such as [Brian Armstrong](https://decrypt.co/111106/coinbase-very-supportive-cftc-bitcoin-ethereum) (Coinbase) and [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1582539579168419840?s=46&t=MIxvyFx75JEnEUfMnNt-Fw) (formerly of FTX). There has been [some discussion](https://decrypt.co/112420/cftc-dccpa-bill-leak-defi-regulation) about the effects of this bill on what has come to be called 'decentralised finance' (or DeFi), with some worrying that it may massively restrict this sector of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFurther, given the [bankruptcy of FTX](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy.html) (and its associated businesses), Sam Bankman-Fried's lobbying in Washington in favour of the DCCPA has raised concerns. At the same time, the FTX crash has also increased calls for regulation more broadly. Recently, both senators Stavenow (D-MI) and Boozman (R-AR) have said that the collapse of FTX showed [\"the need for greater federal oversight of the digital asset industry\"](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-senators-commit-to-advancing-crypto-bill-despite-ftx-collapse). \n\nAs of November 2022, there has not been a clear schedule as to when the bill will be published for the US Senate to review.",

    "question": "Will there be a white Christmas in at least 4 of these 9 large European cities in 2024?",
    "background_text": "Many children wish for a white Christmas, i.e. snow on the days 24th or 25th December. Transit operators and homeless people enjoy it less. It is an important cultural event around the northern Atlantic, though; hence this question!\n\nCultural note: The majority of inhabitants of Instanbul do not celebrate Christmas at all. Neither do all Russians celebrate Christmas in December. These differences are irrelevant for the question, which is focused on Christmas as celebrated by most cultures around the northern Atlantic.\n\n----\n\nThis question uses METAR data as the source for convenience, because it provides a standardised view into actual observed weather at diverse geographical locations. Here's an example of a METAR report:\n\n> METAR UUEE 050800Z 28003MPS 240V320 7000 -SN SCT006 M11/M13 Q1018 R24L/490336 R24C/490336 NOSIG=\n\nThe standard allows for many optional components, but common components are\n\n- The reporting station (in this case UUEE, which is a Moscow airport) comes after the preamble\n- the day and time of observation (in this case 050800Z meaning day 5 of the month, at 8 o'clock UTC)\n- wind speed and direction (in this case 28003MPS meaning 280\u00b0, 3 m/s)\n- visibility (in this case 7000 meaning 7000 metres)\n- cloud cover (in this case SCT006 meaning scattered at 600 feet)\n- temperature (in this case M11/M13 meaning temperature of -11 \u00b0C)\n- air pressure (in this case Q1018 meaning 1018 millibar)\n- runway information, starting with R\n- a near-term forecast (in this case NOSIG meaning no significant change expected)\n\nBut! Critically for this question, there are also indications of precipitation. In the example above, that's \"-SN\" for \"light snow\".\n\nHere are some other examples of reports indicating snow:\n\n> METAR ESSA 270120Z 01005KT 9999 -SN SCT007 BKN009 OVC046 M05/M06 Q1010 RESN BECMG BKN020=`\n\nRESN means \"recent snow\"\n\n> METAR ESNU 252220Z 33009KT 9999 SG FEW018 OVC055 M03/M05 Q1003=\n\nSG means \"snow grains\"\n\n> METAR EFOU 041820Z AUTO 14003KT 9999 -SHSN SCT044 M13/M15 Q1013=\n\n-SHSN means \"light snow shower\"\n\nFor decoding reports, [the web tool by Flight Plan Database](https://flightplandatabase.com/METAR) can be a helpful assistant.",

Additionally, medical marijuana has been legalized in 40 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nWill this changing landscape at the state level influence federal policy? The Schedule I classification, as defined by the Controlled Substances Act, is reserved for substances with a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Given the growing acceptance and legalization of cannabis at the state level, there is increasing debate and speculation about potential changes to its federal classification.",

    "question": "Will a lead-apatite class superconductor with a warm Tc be found before 2025?",
    "background_text": "The supposed room-temperature superconductor LK-99 has inspired lots of discussion. Among the replication attempts are claims that LK-99 is a superconductor at [110K Tc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01192).\n\nIf it is, that would be a new family of unusually high temperature ambient pressure superconductors. So far, all the high temperature ambient pressure superconductors are based on cuprates or iron.\n\nEarly superconductors were all found at very low temperatures, and discoveries above 20K were not made until the 1970s. [High-temperature superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity) are usually defined as those with Tc above 77K, but even superconductors exceeding 30K are fairly unusual materials.\n\nOther superconductor families include metals and metal alloys, nickelates, carbon compounds (fullerenes, nanotubes, diamond, and doped relatives), and some high-pressure families. None of the ceramics and oxides include lead or phosphorous as major constituents.\n\nThe propose LK-99 structure is CuO25P6Pb9. It is almost entirely lead, oxygen, and phosphorus.\n\nOne of the many questions surround LK-99 is whether the described composition is correct, and in particular whether trace impurities are important. Variant recipes have been suggested, along with questions about replacing the copper with other elements.\n\nRather than asking whether LK-99 as described superconducts at room temperature, this question asks the much broader question of whether any related material superconducts at a much broader temperature range.",

In its 2014 election, Libya appointed a House of Representatives as its government.\n\nThe validity of this election was questioned by other political bodies, among them the previous interim government that was to be replaced with the House of Representatives. This situation culminated in the second Libyan civil war.\n\nIn the past nine years since 2014, Libya has been ruled by multiple rival governments in control over various parts of the country. Multiple attempts have been made to unify these governments, of which many have broken down one way or another. \n\nCurrently, Libya is ruled by the transitional Government of National Unity, supported by the House of Representatives. (Although some sources claim the Government of National Unity is opposed by parts of the House of Representatives and several other smaller political organisations.) The Government of National Unity has a president as head of state and in command of the armed forces. This position is currently held by al-Menfi, who was appointed as part of the ongoing peace process.\n\nA free election for the Presidential position has been planned and postponed repeatedly, mainly over conflict about the process and rules for running. The most recent postponement at the end of 2022 did not come with the announcement of a new timeframe. With the last postponement, the electoral democracy index of Libya has taken another dive. That said, a UN envoy says that a new election is in process, and the incumbent prime minister promises 2023 will be a year of elections.",

    "question": "Will Ilya Sutskever still lead OpenAI\u2019s Superalignment team at the end of 2024?",
    "background_text": "OpenAI established the [Superalignment team](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment) to focus on developing ways to steer, regulate, and govern superintelligent AI systems.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, leads this team alongside Jan Leike. The Superalignment team, formed in mid-2023, is a strategic response to the rapid advancements in AI. \n\nOpenAI, recently faced a significant leadership shakeup. Sutskever, serving as the chief scientist and a board member, played a pivotal role in the temporary ousting of CEO Sam Altman. This event raised questions about Sutskever's future role at the company. Although he was instrumental in forming the superalignment team and his contributions remain significant, his current status within OpenAI has been somewhat ambiguous following these events.
