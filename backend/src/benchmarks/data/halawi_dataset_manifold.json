See, for example, here: https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/mysterious-pneumonia-outbreak-china-hospitals-sick-children-b1122117.html\n\nThi sounds worringly similar to Covid (but also dissimilar in some ways). I wonder if this will be a global phenomenon.\n\nAs of December 31st 2023, will this mystery pneumonia spread beyond China in a significant way? I will resolve this question as yes if more than 1000 confirmed or highly likely confirmed cases exist (or have existed between now and then) outside of China on the resolution day.\n\nEDIT from Dec 5 for clarification, as requested in the comments:\n\nThis market specifically concerns a mysterious pathogen, like covid would have been in its early days. This market does not concern existing viruses such as RSV, because that is hardly mysterious.\n\nI understand that the \"mysterious\" pathogen may be a mutation of an existing pathogen (like covid was). This obviously counts, if there has been a substantial mutation (like covid was). Minor mutations (like the constant minor changes to the seasonal flu) dont count. For example, let's assume that the \"mystery pneumonia\" is an RSV outbreak. That would not count, unless it turns out to be a novel Super-RSV with substantially higher mortality/infectiousness/whatever,\n\nAlso, this question pertains to the specific mystery pneumonia observed in China, wherever it may be from. Only this one counts. If this pathogen is originally from a different country and spreads from there, it counts because its still the pathogen that this question is about. If it turns out that there is a second mystery pneumonia that has nothing to do with the current outbreak in China but still spreads globally, it does not count (because this question is about the present outbreak in China).\n",

      "question": "Will Tesla Vehicle deliveries Q4 2023 exceed 500,000?",
      "background_text": "Last five quarters:\n\nQ3 2022: 343820\n\nQ4 2022: 405278\n\nQ1 2023: 422875\n\nQ2 2023: 466140\n\nQ3 2023: 435059.\n\nThe equivalent press release for Q4 2023 will be used but if not available, I may wait for Q4 financial reports. If Semi or Cybertruck numbers are included in the announcement they will be included in the relevant number but if not shown will not be included.\n\nBackground\n\nPrices have been reduced presumably to stimulate demand, but is production also being throttled according to demand? Elon Musk seems to have suggested it is pretty much full pace production and they can generate enough demand by cutting prices. Freemont and Shanghai may well be at or near production capacity limits but Berlin and Texas are ramping up recently reaching 5000 per week production rates. The latest official guidance is\n\n\"For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year.\"\n\nHaving produced 1350996 in the first three quarters 1.8m requires production of 449k.\n\nHowever, at 2022 Q4 earnings there were some suggestions that 2 million may not be impossible. 1.8 million is only 450k per quarter and they have managed near 440k in 2 quarters to March 2023 and near 480k in Q2 2023 so does practically no growth or even reductions with two factories ramping up make any sense? So one line of reasoning queried whether the 1.8 million figure was a well sandbagged number or whether demand causing production to be throttled back?\n\nAbove may have failed to account for other explanations: Q2 Earning call suggested there would be production shutdowns but it isn't clear to what extent these were for upgrading production speed compared to other things like retool for Highland upgrade. While there were shutdowns, did this fully account for lower production or were there also speed reduction?",
