    "background_text": "From the onset of the Gaza-Israel conflict, many pro-Israeli nations have shown their support for Israel via high profile visits including, US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nUkraine is another nation which is seen as pro-Israeli, however, in past and present times, the relationship between both nations has appeared tentative. Israel still maintains friendly relations with Russia, and Israel has yet to outright condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Israel has also, until recently, refused to send military aid to Ukraine which is in stark contrast to many of Israel's western allies.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy initially indicated his intention to visit Israel in a show of support, however this was initially shot-down by Netanyahu, stating that the \"time is not right\".\nThis decision was short-lived, as it was recently reported that Zelenskyy's trip to Israel was in advanced stages of planning. Said reporting, however, was leaked (presumably by members of Netenyahu's government), and the trip was promptly cancelled:\nAccording to the diplomat, the Ukrainian president \"wanted the trip to be public when he stepped on Israeli soil.\" \"He's very disappointed,\" he added.",

    "question": "Will Delhi perform cloud seeding before December 1, 2023?",
    "background_text": "New Delhi, the capital of India, has been experiencing very poor air quality. According to data from AirNow, the majority of the month of November has been at an air quality index (AQI) level of \"Very Unhealthy\" or worse, and nearly half of the month has been at levels of \"Hazardous\".\nAccording to a November 10th Nature article:\nAs the Hindu festival of Diwali kicks off on 10 November, the Indian capital of Delhi, already blanketed in choking smog, is bracing for pollution to worsen. Over the past week, children struggling to breath the acrid air have flooded hospital emergency departments, and schools have been forced to close. . .\n\u201cEvery year it is a similar story,\u201d says Vinayak Sinha, an atmospheric chemist at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali.\nBut although Delhi\u2019s air is attracting attention now, scientists say that the spike is actually typical for this time of year. The post-monsoon season, which lasts from October to December, delivers an annual pollution bomb to Delhi, a megacity of more than 30 million people. Other cities in India are also plagued by poor air quality at this time of year.\nSinha says that atmospheric conditions after the monsoon exacerbate pollution. Rainfall that washes pollutants out of the air during the monsoon ceases. As temperatures fall, the upper boundary of the troposphere \u2014 the lowest layer of atmosphere \u2014 drops in altitude and the troposphere shrinks. That causes the soup of pollutants in the troposphere to become more concentrated, says Sinha. \u201cYou have a smaller container now into which your air emissions are being stored,\u201d he says.\nEven so, current conditions came as something of a surprise, says Karthik Ganesan, a policy researcher at the Council on Energy Environment and Water in New Delhi. That\u2019s because the amount of crop waste burnt in the neighbouring Punjab region was lower than usual this year, causing some people to expect a milder increase in pollution.\nBut as it turned out, air quality was as poor as ever because of changing meteorological conditions, including drops in wind speed on certain days. When wind speed falls, the air stagnates, trapping local emissions and leading to a pollution spike, says Ganesan.\nNew Delhi is reportedly considering new approaches to improve the air quality, such as cloud seeding. According to Wired:\nIndia\u2019s capital, New Delhi, is preparing a new weapon in the fight against deadly air pollution: cloud seeding. The experiment, which could take place as early as next week, would introduce chemicals like silver iodide into a cloudy sky to create rain and, it\u2019s hoped, wash away the fine particulate matter hovering over one of the world\u2019s largest cities.\nThe need is desperate. Delhi has already tried traffic restriction measures, multimillion-dollar air filtration towers, and the use of fleets of water-spraying trucks to dissolve the particulate matter in the air\u2014but to no avail.\n. . .\nNow, Delhi officials are seeking permission from federal agencies in India to try cloud seeding. The technique involves flying an aircraft to spray clouds with salts like silver or potassium iodide or solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, to induce precipitation. The chemical molecules attach to moisture already in the clouds to form bigger droplets that then fall as rain. China has used artificial rain to tackle air pollution in the past\u2014but for cloud seeding to work properly, you need significant cloud cover with reasonable moisture content, which Delhi generally lacks during the winter. If weather conditions are favorable, scientists leading the project at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur plan to carry out cloud seeding around November 20.",

The alert quotes an article published by FTV News, a publication by the Taiwanese broadcasting company Formosa Television.\nProMED quoted the machine translated article as follows:\nWith the outbreak of pneumonia in China, children's hospitals in Beijing, Liaoning and other places were overwhelmed with sick children, and schools and classes were on the verge of suspension. Parents questioned whether the authorities were covering up the epidemic.\nIn the early morning, Beijing Children's Hospital was still overcrowded with parents and children whose children had pneumonia and came to seek treatment. Mr. [W], a Beijing citizen: \"Many, many are hospitalized. They don't cough and have no symptoms. They just have a high temperature (fever) and many develop pulmonary nodules.\"\nThe situation in Liaoning Province is also serious. The lobby of Dalian Children's Hospital is full of sick children receiving intravenous drips. There are also queues of patients at the traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and the central hospitals. A staff member of Dalian Central Hospital said: \"Patients have to wait in line for 2 hours, and we are all in the emergency department and there are no general outpatient clinics.\"\nSome school classes have even been canceled completely. Not only are all students sick, but teachers are also infected with pneumonia. ...\nMr. [W], a Beijing citizen: \"Now you are not allowed to report to school. If you have any symptoms such as fever, cold, cough and then you are hospitalized, you can ask for leave...\"\nSince China stopped adhering to the \"zero\" policy at the beginning of the year [2023], epidemics such as influenza, mycoplasma, and bronchopneumonia have broken out from time to time. ...\nA novel pathogen is generally considered to be one which has not previously been found to infect humans.",

Critically for this question, there are also indications of precipitation. In the example above, that's \"-SN\" for \"light snow\".\nHere are some other examples of reports indicating snow:\nMETAR ESSA 270120Z 01005KT 9999 -SN SCT007 BKN009 OVC046 M05/M06 Q1010 RESN BECMG BKN020=`\nRESN means \"recent snow\"\nMETAR ESNU 252220Z 33009KT 9999 SG FEW018 OVC055 M03/M05 Q1003=\nSG means \"snow grains\"\nMETAR EFOU 041820Z AUTO 14003KT 9999 -SHSN SCT044 M13/M15 Q1013=\n-SHSN means \"light snow shower\"\nFor decoding reports, the web tool by Flight Plan Database can be a helpful assistant.",

Valid votes are defined as votes cast for either Sergio Massa or Javier Milei, excluding votes that are blank, null, etc. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of valid votes each candidate receives by the sum of all valid votes received by both candidates.\n\nFor example, if Milei receives 53% of the valid votes, and Massa receives 47% of the valid votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the Milei margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (Milei% - Massa% = Margin of Victory).\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the Argentine government (e.g. https://www.argentina.gob.ar/interior/dine).",

See, for example, here: https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/mysterious-pneumonia-outbreak-china-hospitals-sick-children-b1122117.html\n\nThi sounds worringly similar to Covid (but also dissimilar in some ways). I wonder if this will be a global phenomenon.\n\nAs of December 31st 2023, will this mystery pneumonia spread beyond China in a significant way? I will resolve this question as yes if more than 1000 confirmed or highly likely confirmed cases exist (or have existed between now and then) outside of China on the resolution day.\n\nEDIT from Dec 5 for clarification, as requested in the comments:\n\nThis market specifically concerns a mysterious pathogen, like covid would have been in its early days. This market does not concern existing viruses such as RSV, because that is hardly mysterious.\n\nI understand that the \"mysterious\" pathogen may be a mutation of an existing pathogen (like covid was). This obviously counts, if there has been a substantial mutation (like covid was). Minor mutations (like the constant minor changes to the seasonal flu) dont count. For example, let's assume that the \"mystery pneumonia\" is an RSV outbreak. That would not count, unless it turns out to be a novel Super-RSV with substantially higher mortality/infectiousness/whatever,\n\nAlso, this question pertains to the specific mystery pneumonia observed in China, wherever it may be from. Only this one counts. If this pathogen is originally from a different country and spreads from there, it counts because its still the pathogen that this question is about. If it turns out that there is a second mystery pneumonia that has nothing to do with the current outbreak in China but still spreads globally, it does not count (because this question is about the present outbreak in China).\n",

If Semi or Cybertruck numbers are included in the announcement they will be included in the relevant number but if not shown will not be included.\n\nBackground\n\nPrices have been reduced presumably to stimulate demand, but is production also being throttled according to demand? Elon Musk seems to have suggested it is pretty much full pace production and they can generate enough demand by cutting prices. Freemont and Shanghai may well be at or near production capacity limits but Berlin and Texas are ramping up recently reaching 5000 per week production rates. The latest official guidance is\n\n\"For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year.\"\n\nHaving produced 1350996 in the first three quarters 1.8m requires production of 449k.\n\nHowever, at 2022 Q4 earnings there were some suggestions that 2 million may not be impossible. 1.8 million is only 450k per quarter and they have managed near 440k in 2 quarters to March 2023 and near 480k in Q2 2023 so does practically no growth or even reductions with two factories ramping up make any sense? So one line of reasoning queried whether the 1.8 million figure was a well sandbagged number or whether demand causing production to be throttled back?\n\nAbove may have failed to account for other explanations: Q2 Earning call suggested there would be production shutdowns but it isn't clear to what extent these were for upgrading production speed compared to other things like retool for Highland upgrade. While there were shutdowns, did this fully account for lower production or were there also speed reduction?",
